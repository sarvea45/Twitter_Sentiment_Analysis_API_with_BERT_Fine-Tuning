i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler happy madison production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour  there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie i realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all the acting was horrible the cinematography was very poor the plot made no sense at all i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing overall i was very unimpressed with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it,0
not to waste your time watching this vanity project ive had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the suspicion that someone involved with gone isnt happy with what i had to say so ive pared things down to the nittygritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary   gone is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words horrible stilted dialogue a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water acting that would embarrass the most selfcentered of community theater divas cinematography inspired by the survivor school of swooping crane shots followed by static nostrilexploring closeups terrible adr work special visual effects that arent pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades no art direction to speak ofthe litany of badness just goes on and oni felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of ittime that could have been better spent staring at a wallunder no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this movie because long before its over they will be wishing they had been raptured before they made that mistake   case closed amen,0
im not sure this film could ever match the first one even if it starred the original seven notwithstanding the fact that four were killed it just doesnt have the spark and chemistry all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecks  its interesting how yul brynner is magnificent in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel yet when he stars in westworld and futureworld in the 1970s his character in the same matching black pants shirt and hat evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 films chris adams  theres nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching even on cable,0
porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has glen jacobs kane from wwfwwe whatever it calls itself nowadays in his cinematic debut he plays jacob goodknight a blind serial killer whos forte is taking peoples eyes out the plot be it as it may has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that goodknight resides in and subsequently being offed by him hemmingway its not starts of as fun dopey bmovie but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable glad i went in with pretty low expectations but even those werent met how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity for shame  my grade d   eye candy samantha noble bares her ass briefly,0
the internet is a wondrous thing is it not i am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries vietnamthe ten thousand day war from my dvr in florida usa to my laptop in kuwait im writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in vietnam amazing i would like to just say that for minh nguyen to make the statement that america brought the war to vietnam is one sided i know america was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war the soviets and the chinese were major arms providers to the north so why mr nguyen doesnt mention them as partially to blame is showing an ignorance well i think we all know why he doesnt mention them either ignorance from being raised in a communist system and its political dogma or because he to scared to say the truth for fear of being arrested also mr nguyen i guess the parts about the north being the main aggressor it whole war were not shown in your country so to blame america again shows ignorance regardless its interesting to read a review from vietnam of course that could be made up as well but ill take that as real at least the communist east is somewhat open as far as the mini series why do i love it it doesnt focus on the american involvement solely this was a war that started 15 years before america got involved and the series covers every facet of the history so thats a real plus the footage used is first rate all the vietnam war programs you see made now will use the same footage so you are not missing anything by watching this older series the date this series was made is another plus it has all the major players being interviewed which you cant do now because they are dead from old age its a major historical reference third richard basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice his voice sounds as distinguished as james earl jones voice would and i think thats very steep praise i dont think you could find a better war documentary ever made its like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of world war two it does that for the vietnam war  ok i do see some bias its subtle a 1970s80s style subtle bias kind of like npr all things considered bias where it all seems so straight forward but when you blink you end up shaking your head in this shows case the later episodes dont throw a whole lot of light on the role of the media and propaganda in general all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war dont you think   from an oif war veteran going through the same thing 30 years later,1
all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate its gotta be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes ghoulies iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called ghoulies mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2 hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber cement and a handful of glitter this sucked,0
first of all this movie is gross to the point of nauseating and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again i tried watching it because it looked like it might be funny but it soon became quite disturbing with the ice cream made out of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects it opens with a boy named greg witnessing the gruesome murder of an ice cream man greg subsequently goes crazy and grows up to be the title character by what appear to be mob assassins there is no explanation for this murder making it the biggest wtf moment in the entire movie other lesser wtf moments include the surreal asylum greg goes to featuring evil clowns a woman speaking in tongues because she has been possessed by the holy spirit what this has to do with anything i dont know and the fact that olivia holy crap has her career tanked this badly hussey is in it  none of these are good enough reasons to watch it the only reason is for the character tuna who is a skinny kid with pillows stuffed under his shirt so that he looks like a fat kid for some reason this struck me as hilarious i stayed up far longer into the night than i should have watching this movie just to figure out if there was some reason they couldnt use an actual fat kid for the role although i fell asleep before the end ive gathered from other reviews that tuna ends up losing the weight okay so they didnt have the budget to pull this off realistically suggestion to the director how about making the character not overweight   thats it if the prospect of tuna has not interested you enough there is no other reason to acknowledge this films existence if disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your preferred source of entertainment check out the far superior the stuff instead,0
im trying to find something of value here the best i can muster is that truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious painful puerile annoying illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love if that was his goal then he succeeded but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch  there is one scene that screams for a spoof belmondo compares the features of deneuves face to the features in a landscape  all i could think the whole time was glacier ice floe two lonely fishermen wearing army surplus on a frozen lake in minnesota  the only other point of interest was the resurrection of buffoons theory of climatic determinism the tropics are presented as paradise and things get progressively worse as they get colder hell being calvinist french switzerland that was kind of funny,0
sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the worlds foremost detective sherlock holmes basil rathbone outwits the nazis  manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr franz tobel william post jr out of the country  to the relative safety of london but is london as safe as holmes thinks dr tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever  he has agreed to give it to the british government but those nazis want it just as badly  holmes arch enemy professor moriarty lionel atwill plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight  selling it to the nazis add the bumbling inspector lestrade denis hoey of scotland yard dr tobels love interest charlotte eberli kaaren verne assassins mysterious scientists  a puzzling coded message  holmes has his work cut out to keep dr tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight  directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939  1946 to feature rathbone  bruce as holmes  watson the script by edward t lowe jr scott darling  edmund l hartmann is based on the short the dancing men by sir arthur conan doyle  isnt the tradition holmes murder mystery as its more of a wartime adventure story to neglect what holmes is all about the solving of complex crimes  mysteries is a big mistake as far as im concerned  the involvement of the nazis  the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place awkward  just didnt sit too well with me the dialogue isnt great professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldnt come up with a villain for it  as a whole its far less engaging than others in the series however at least its short  director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack  bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago it has no real style or imagination  lacks both atmosphere  intrigue as well  technically the film is ok if unspectacular the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available the acting is alright bruce  hoey do their usual comic relief turns  rathbones hairstyle in this looks ridiculous  im glad he changed it for later instalments  sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series there is very little by which i can recommend it  everything that made the others so good seems to be missing here leave this one till last  watch some of the better ones first for die hard fans only,0
thats certainly not the best film ever but thats certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind so the one who loves sadness and depression and scary fairytales at night and wolves and real madness  welcome if you find a copy of course as for me i could stand it only once but since that the wolves and saintlucy and childrens drawings and a headless christ live in my nightmares,1
i went to see this because of snipes  statham but honestly chaos is terrible this movie has absolutely nothing going for it  it should not have been made  dont read this review if you dont want to read spoilers cause im going to address a lot of plotholes here  first of all  the opening scene its the great big event that made the two semilead characters statham and snipes turn crooked but its boring and mundane only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you wont care anymore also  this whole event where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles as referred to in the movie  then the bank job  it doesnt get off the ground for any second the bank robber makes some unneeded references to chaos theory which has nothing to do with the whole story by the way the way statham gets summoned is very die hard with a vengeance but more boring then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless whats with the safety deposit box there seems to be some plot unfolding there but then it doesnt why go through the trouble of stringing up two people when it leads to nothing it involves a lot of preparation and its used for nothing at all why doesnt the swat leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down  and this is only the first 10 minutes it keeps getting worse and worse   the whole romantic  love interest story with the he wasnt just a better cop he was a better man remark to finish it of is painful to watch its just pointless why would stathams character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank this essentially leads to finding the virus that will get him all the money why go through the trouble of forging some guys signature and killing him but then not kill the guy that can identify you  i could go on for ages really but its like this movie is pointless the whole script is a mess the smart references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic the plot twists can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time it is really painful to watch a movie like this where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn crunching people of which the director hopes they wont see all the plot holes and the overall ridiculous script the explanation scene at the end only adds to insult it is really really not a good movie in any way  people who come to see an action film dont get what they come for people who come to see a copbuddy movie dont get it people who come to see a smart thriller dont get that in essence everyone gets the same  a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money do yourself a favor and skip this one,0
all credit to writerdirector gilles mimouni who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal while keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arms length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on even his clever denouement has you guessing  the three central performances are also top class with vincent cassel romane bohringer and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery jeanphillippe ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair  thierry arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and cardine biggerstaffs editing keeps the story a step ahead of us the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script  many may say gilles mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love for me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web only the french are capable of such tantalisation hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending  monday march 2 1998  hoyts croydon  noone does thriller quite like the french when they get it right they really get it right  vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max romane bohringer obsessive as the new lisa and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa the plot from gilles mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires  all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads as lucien jeanphillippe ecoffey is strong and emotional  friday january 15 1999  video,1
i watched the halloween episodeoh my god i wanted to die the acting was just awful the lines were uttered with absolutely no conviction its a bad idea for a show as well i mean who would watch some web show like that in real life miranda cosgrove was great in a supporting role in drake and josh but doesnt have the force of character to anchor her own show im even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why drake and josh ended she was approached with her own showshe jumped ship on drake and josh they then decided that maybe they would do a thing with drake and josh moving to college thereby explaining the loss of meagan as a character but drake had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if miranda did it why couldnt he the best part of the show was the theme song a catchy good tune in a mire of mediocrity of course drake bell was dubbing mirandas voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune,0
burt reynolds plays gator mcklusky a likable exconvict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff laidback reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these good ol boy performances in true hes on autopilot throughout but in his day reynolds knew just how to make a lowkey effort work well for himself ingratiating and handsome reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star while director joesph sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the south alive unfortunately the story isnt much and supporting actors ned beatty and bo hopkins overact as usual diane ladd is fine in a small part and reallife daughter laura dern can be glimpsed in the background reynolds returned to this character for 1976s gator 12 from,0
the other lowestrating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that ive only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday omnibus my god its depressing like all soaps it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but its ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who mocked the true to life bilge spouted by its defenders was spoton if anyone lived in a social environment like this theyd slash their wrists within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that its rather more ethnically enriched than youll ever see here take my advice  avoid this nadir of the british tv industry it is evil,0
utterly useless having been there done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect it may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire unrealistic drivel so many cringeworthy scenes that would put the office to shame not a compliment to this film it also may have helped to have some semblance of a story a point a message a commentary anything seriously kevin  perry go large had more to say on the subject than this film term used very loosely in this case there should be minus numbers reserved for films like this 10 extra turd,0
sister helen is a superb documentary about a rigid intolerant foul mouthed bitter oblate civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunksaddicts robert the only middle class representative  he had a real job house and even a bmw  regrets she died before he could tell her off why   robert like six of the residents was on parole he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didnt cowtow to her in an extras interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life  her husband and her two boys   the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 helen was left with one daughter who she abandoned to run the center the daughter was not pleased she wanted her mom  whats fascinating is how little helen changed outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times  once with the directors narrating  it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males   helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars but her bossiness intolerance and sharp tongue didnt emerge at age 56 living with her must have been extremely difficult even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen   the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter supposedly she is showing off her street savvy another time she publicly demeans mel her assistant for not bathing for a year then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people her signature song is my way her favorite phrase is im going to be totally honest with you often people who use such phrases turn out o be the opposite   the residents are really down and out only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom they all desperately need a roof over their heads and helen since she runs the place on her own has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding it is her show   helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug shes no therapist just a landlady who dyes her hair wears a habit and wields complete power over her tenants and stopped drinking   helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ureen she calls it tests on requests twice major a very solid and respected long term older resident  who she trusted  failed his tests helen was furious and evicted him major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin helen didnt yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time yet she discounted her relationship with him assumed he was a liar and relied completely on the results major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate helen never apologized publicly but supposedly made up with major privately  helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someones tires the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have hisher tires slashed she was not a nice woman so eventually she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive  since the three male travises died  was to start the travis center  for some of the residents it was a great deal they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap safe sober and structured place to live one however said he preferred jail addicts and drunks dont all need to be treated like children helen employed old school techniques which have been discredited however no one was forced to remain at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience the travis center is not a treatment center it is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives   to receive the full sister helen experience see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests,1
ive watched hundreds of kung fu movies and ive heard some good thing about this movie so i decided to give it a try what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making ive ever seen  i cant help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie everyone overacts to the point of stupidity even conan the barbarian had some civility this movie just has halfevolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no selfrespect the narrators character shouldve be killed for sucking so muchshe really didnt deserve to live til the end the entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action they shouldve just rename this movie to the stupid onearmed caveman with a blade heres a questionwhy do some director use quick cuts for some action movies answer to can hide the deficiencies of the actors nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow the movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kungfu moviesor any taste in movies,0
yesa real stinker i saw this movie on the advice of my sweet friends who told me that this is a great psychological movie this film makes every effort not to be understandable i was aware that i was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutesi waited since i expected to see something valuable and most important of all i paid for this film the wait was unbearable after seeing the film i talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments  they call themselves under this title  of turkey this movie had recognised as a masterpiece yes a masterpiece but in the category of stinkersi think that a movie must be selfexplanatory this film is just the opposite keep away from this thing which calls itself a movie burn your money instead of paying for this phenomenon rate 1 out of 10,0
there is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice in most cases this is mainly a recommendation you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice however for mulholland dr this is different the sequence that worked for me was see it first time  spend a day in internet trying to figure out what this was all about  and then see it second time otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious camera work is stunning and the aftertaste follows you for weeks  910,1
sorry to say but was disappointed in the film it was very very rushed as i suppose you can understand a movie length version of pride  prejudice would be and i felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story as the movie is so rushed unfortunately you dont get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all   not only that this movie is boring i say that with a capital b 13 of the way through i started yawning and couldnt wait for the movie to be over as i have read the book and watch the bbc version i knew how many scenes had to go before i could finally leave the cinema mr darcy whoever he is in this movie definitely cant act he looks also too young to play mr darcy every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something where is the build up at first he seems confused with everything he is just bizarre it all looks put on   was trying not to compare to the colin firth version but if you love that version you will most likely be disappointed anyway  the costumes are absolutely shocking where are the corsets i know elizabeth is poor but i think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion and hasnt been brought up in a squaller her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of england  i didnt agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact that i dont think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things honestly mr bingley who has wealth should know better there is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in and not at all like jane austen bingleys character is shockingly donee to me he behaves like a simpleton not a character to like and respect what about that laugh of his i wickham hardly has a presence and mr  mrs hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all keira did okay but it just aint the same,0

back in the 60s this grim study of joy a young proletarian wife was the introduction to the career of ken loach who became one of the most distinguished and respected british filmmakers of all time by then i knew very little about brecht politics or the reality of the underprivileged and i was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film its free style its austere color cinematography and joys monologues in front of the camera i was also much surprised to find that terence stamp who had become a celebrity thanks to billy budd the collector and modesty blaise had so little screen time although 20th century fox distributed poor cow in panama loach did not stay in mainstream cinema which this film hardly is and i lost contact with his films i just heard of his successes kes family life black jack until i caught up in the 80s the beautiful title song by donovan by the way is available in his anthology troubadour,1
warning may contain spoilers   the ripples in the wake of the first jaws movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience ie the ocean deep space genetics although jaws was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original shark rosso nelloceano aka devil fish or red ocean is a dutiful follower of the original jaws formula after several hapless boats and seagoers are brutally murdered by some ocean creature there is an initial drive to discover the beast then a failure to study it without horrible results and a final push to destroy it although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy the result is nothing short of disastrous this movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing brittle acting and cheap scares   the most sickly compelling feature of devil fish is its cookiecutter editing from the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility it appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music furthermore every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms fade wipe or dissolve the impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of timelapse image of their act is composited over their bodies   the music is equally bland the creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the jaws theme with slight variation although i like to keep my reviews devoid of mst3k influence mike most aptly described the somber score as soft core porn music failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to devil fish the acting is stale the relationships baffling and the whole conspiracy is laughable the question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests why couldnt a more practical use be administered to better mankind one of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster even though its film presence is less than stellar   overall this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre if jaws had never been made then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively sadly as a carbon copy of spielbergs original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese,0
i wasnt expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy its noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of its star john garfield  garfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria dickson and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was an actor ahead of his peers before the term method was even coined and before brando ever screamed stella he brings natural to the screen his earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that golden boy role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worth  ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jacks trampy girl goldie i havent ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here she plays well off garfield dicksons performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude rains is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actor  also interesting to note is the director busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably  a very good film that deserves greater attention 810,1

this has to be the worst movie ive seen this year and i watch a lot of cable the plot is just ridiculous the scenes are just thrown at you with no action no start or ending of any scene its just random idiots with makeup that scream in some plane the special effects  spielberg would laugh his ass off  are horrible the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though i have to admin that i couldnt bear to watch it to the end the scene where the great scientist bennett was holding for dear life by the engine body was too much for me im sorry for my bad english i am from romania  and this is my first post  i had to sign up just to make a comment on this movie because i just cant believe that this is a movie released in 2007,0
dont waste your time one of those coollooking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a hunch but not even worth that you will not say its so bad its good just its bad the greatest american hero is a writer who rents a cabin on african island called snake island some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off but they are not staying on the island they just stop there to let off the writer then the boat is stranded there and in true hollywood originality the one and only radio on the island is busted so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes like hundreds of them which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere its not like there ever was one main snake like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes instead there are just a bunch of hamandegger snakes of all kinds of breeds their only goal then was to escape the islandas opposed to having to conquer the enemy because there were so many snakes you knew they couldnt possibly try to kill them all and they didnt try ive seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending in snake island by the way every single character was shocked to see snakes on the islandduhhhhh its named snake island for a reason there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat oh they never do get gas by the way they just happen to find another boat on the island already gassed up,0
as an avid disney fan i was not totally impressed by this movie certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters i am however so glad that i caught it on dvd and watched the special features  you must check out the moose commentary the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from rutt and tuke the comic relief moose of the story who are voiced by rick moranis and dave thomas two veterans of the famous second city comedy troupe adlib  in character  for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of i laughed the whole time the enjoyment i got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction i had to the film itself do yourself a favor and listen to it,0
well im not the worlds biggest sondheim fan so although i have the cast album and ive listened to it a few times ive never actually seen this show performed and i havent seen the tim burton movie version either i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie this version isnt a movie at all its a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast including most importantly angela lansburys performance as nellie lovett this is one of those performances thats just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself she must have had so much fun with this role sweeney todd himself isnt played by len cariou who did it originally but by george hearn hearn does a fantastic job his voice isnt quite as good as carious but he seems to play it a bit broader  the only problem i had really was with the johanna character as played by betsy joslyn and to some extent her lover anthony as played by cris groenendaal joslyns voice cant sustain high notes but i wasnt entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since im not hugely familiar with this play more importantly im not sure if the story of sweeney todd really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music but thankfully the whole thing doesnt seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators as a lark and a bit of comedy in the vein of grand guignol its quite enjoyable i dont feel like its as significant a piece of work as company and into the woods or some of his other shows some of the music is quite spectacular but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show  i wont say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film but just a play that has been shot on film there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it people will want to see this because it preserves lansburys legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because its a hilarious and insightful performance george hearn can be proud of his version of sweeney as well this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and cannibalism will really surprise them seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater because i prefer shows from the 20s through the 50s to these later era affairs sweeney todd is an exceptional show from its era however miles and miles above the al webber madness,1
this is a brilliant film the story starts off in romaniawhere billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything there is a really funny scene here where crystal is a child and talks his father who is a rabbi into eating pork you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of crystals religion he is mainly a talent scout and hes trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew he accidently falls into a small river believing he is dead some huge hands come out to reach him he later thinks he is in heaven he finds out that he isnt but that he is in a monastery believing god saved him he becomes a monk searching for who saved him he later finds a 7 ft 7 in man who he casts as the perfect villain he also recites shakespeare see the film and find out the rest,1
after seeing forever hollywood it would be natural to want to see a john waters film at least one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known nonmainstream director its worth the effort and pf is a lot better than eraserheadand there is a certain campiness about his films which his followers find addicting,0
wow we watched this film in the hopes that it would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes we were disappointed there but it was still a great movie it was soooo cheesy it was great i havent laughed so hard at a movie in a long time if you are into rock climbing and you enjoy cheesy movies then this one is absolutely for you,1
this has to be one of the funniest movies ive ever seen the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness when mom and dad both lose there jobs not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub they decide its in their families best interest to move to oregon once there everything goes wrong an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie including a young molly ringwaldthis a movie i would definetly recommend,1
the movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts but it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the feeling  as keith richards remarks in paul mccartneys movie about holly theres some buddy holly in almost all rock made since his day the tragedy that took him is dealt with gently and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music  gary busey does a remarkable energetic portrayal of holly and his performances hint that he really gets into the music as a longtime holly fan and rocker so do i,1
when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that im a little older i can say that although its thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention in contrast its good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n slashers of 70s and 80s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are hamfisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but its better than anything norris did in the 90s,0
freddy forsyth has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the wests suspicions about putins russia forsyth installs a nasty guy as the ruski president who wants to return the country  not so much to stalins communism but more to hitlerian fascism in fact his political manifesto could have come straight out of mein kampf rather than marx and the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the russian federation american mercenaries connive with the russian prez to realise his fanatical genocidal dream but then enter dirty dancings pat swayzeandyepthings get really down and dirty hes a former us operativeturneddrifterjason monk who is enlisted by the british government to see what the russians are up to as a corny sidebar swayzes character who is no monk has sired a russian beauty elena played by the gorgeous marta kondova on his previous missions to the former commie state hardman swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians but young unknown actress marta kondova steals the flick as his nubile 18yearold russian daughter elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia,0
bloody birthday is an odd and at times humorous lowbudget horror flick along the lines of mikey or a less intelligent version of the good son  set in a small californian town three babies are born at the height of an eclipse where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions ten years later our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree doing away with parents siblings teachers and anyone else who irritates them only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time arent equally as twisted but there you go  for a slasher film its very tame in terms of violence and gore which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to instead its amusing and a little disturbing seeing three tenyearolds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns knives and crossbows the main reason why it doesnt descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth  bloody birthday is rather mediocre as a horror flick with few scares and little blood but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers it is a bit unique in that way one to watch if theres nothing else on,0
not often it happens that a great directors last movie becomes such a moving brillantly performed and filmed masterpiece the cast is excellent as well as the camerawork what starts up as a merry comingtogether of a group of welleducated citizens of an early20thcentury dublin turns into a dark philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past thank you mister huston for this last piece of great cinema,1
people criticize nsna because it is a lowpoint in bond god sean connerys career and because it is unofficial may contain spoilers first of all this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then connery all sub par wannabes in my book sean connery is the only real bond no one comes even close to his toughness good looks and sex appeal yes this movie is a low point in connerys bond career but it is still the definet best bond film of the 80s sean connery is the only bond actor who is good at an older age he did not become a baggy mess like moore but kept his good looks and toughness but gaining some gray hair so what hes still the only real 007 and he is as cool and tough as ever sean connery is the one and only 007 and this movie is definitly worth seeing no matter what anyone says no gunbarrel opening but you cant have everything can you great theme song though,1
this eloquent simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father though a theatrical release it has a madefortv quality we can attribute this to the director john frankenheimer who learned his craft in the early days of live television in new york city indeed he directed the teleplay on which the film is based deal a blow on the cbs drama series climax young stranger represents his hollywood debut after a hiatus of four years during which he would do more television he returned to direct the young savages with burt lancaster and a year after that all fall down with warren beatty and angela lansbury  the casting is competent with james daly and kim hunter particularly good playing the parents of the title character performed by james macarthur his first theatrical film who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen look for james gregory and whit bissell in supporting roles,1

one of the few reasons to make these pointlss films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if theyre acting is any good the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this theres 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jump  young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines when one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies the adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh eaters when still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so they must become enraged at any adult which exploited them int he mines only reason that come to mind  a mother and her 2 daughters move into a house near the mine along with a land devoloper who wants to build a resort and another of those creepy people who seem to know exactly whats going on yet no one believes him  nothing new here youre usual clichs predictable a lot of negatives for this film very few positives,0
ross hunters musical remake of the 1937 fantasy based on james hiltons enduring bestseller was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973 sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in hollywood for years group of disparate british and american individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a wartorn asian country but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called shangrila where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content some of the performances by the classy cast arent so classy the effervescent mood of the piece the lilting burt bacharachhal david tunes as well as the lightweight direction all conspire to make the performers look just a bit silly peter finch is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident liv ullmann sally kellerman is a malcontent who spits out lines like i got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off so that people with their heads still onand usually under hairdryerscould get one last kick before turning to the latest recipe john gieguld as chang an asian who learned to speak english while attending oxford is humorously selfamused but why no songs for chang hal davids dopey lyrics are sometimes jawdropping on the good ship lollipophow did christopher columbussail across the sea and the pacing gets bogged down with all that chatter about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today however the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting the twodimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing and the movies silliness is infectious it ends up being a lot of fun  from,1
id like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie  1 angelina jolie sex scene   2 foley artist outdid themselves   3 plot was quite thick   4 dvd does includes trailers and chapter stops  5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie   6 homages to blade runner through out the film   7 burning trash cans   8 funny guy with no legs   9 voice overs by jack palance added a real dynamic element to the film   10 sage advise for example when you dine with the devil bring a long spoon   11 angelina jolie was only 18   to sum it up an evening of entertainment was provided,1
k murli mohan rao made the much better bandhan in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singer  basically in short the film consists of salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenes  jackie shroff wasted bored and tired his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of pooja bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer  inder kumar confusing characterization again  rani mukherjee boring overweight and does nothing special pooja bhatra tall fair and actress worthy but lacks talent  kashmira shah says a dial as if a poetry  mohinish behl poor fellow the 2 kids were awful too  the story is the same and has awful comic scenes a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of shakti kapoor  direction is poor music is decent  salman khan just goes through the motions jackie is bad rani is as usual pooja is bad mohinish and kashmira are nothing great inder is awful,0
world war i gets a glossy sepiatinted makeover in jeanpierre jeunets relentlessly whimsical a very long engagement jeunets trademark style consists of mechanical almost clockworklike narrative construction garnished with lavish chocolate box production values and seasoned with fauxnaive humour its an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture the romantic fantasy amelie thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of audrey tatou in the title role applied to vastly more sombre material jeunets method backfires rather badly  tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly offbeat character as amelie shes mathilde an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart manech gaspard ulliel several years after he went missing in the war manech was one of five soldiers courtmartialled for selfmutilation in 1917 at bingo crepuscule and sent over the top into nomansland as a punishment hes presumed dead by all but mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him the film follows mathildes dogged quest to find out what really happened and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad even shocking story of highranking corruption and inhumanity mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be manechs final hours  all this should be poignant and gripping but its more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which jeunet pummels his audience theres simply too much going on at any one time including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters without a moments respite from informational overload i felt denied the space to reflect on mathildes quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms jeunets unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the storys skin the result is deeply uninvolving and worse grotesque the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history imagine it recreated as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known belgian lager and you have the measure of this film,0
this is not a serious film and does not pretend to be but it is not as bad as some of its reviews its title and the first ten minutes lead you to expect  the plot is very silly but this adds to the lighthearted fun and enthusiasm which runs through the film the characters are played sympathetically and while they do engage in typical teenage angst they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality usually to be found in this film genre  unusually set in london sympathetic to geeks this is well worth a watch if it happens to be on if you want some tongueincheek silliness and dont mind suspending your disbelief,1
i had high hopes going to see this as i always enjoy paul bettanys performances i thought he was very good as darwin and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with  darwins book on the origin of species was one of the most groundbreaking controversial and innovative publications ever yet youd never think it based on this tedious movie its like a twohour episode of a soap opera in a victorian setting there is virtually nothing about darwins fiveyear voyage on the beagle to the galapagos islands for example surely of supreme significance to the story as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolution  this is just one long dreary domestic drama with darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionallyconstipated wife jennifer connellys portrayal of emma darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real emma there could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth from either emma or from the local priest as played by jeremy northam a blinkandyoudmissit part which is a complete waste of a talented actor to act as a counterbalance to darwins views but it wasnt taken up   the story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about darwins grief for his daughter annie and too much time was also wasted in darwin wondering whether or not to write his book eventually i was so bored it was difficult to care   all in all this was a bit like making a movie about picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist,0
i watched this film on telly the other night and little did i know what a cringefest it would bei knew it would be stupid but not this bad this film exemplifies everything that is awful in australian comedy apart from the most tedious uninspired scenarios and characters i have ever come across aside from those dubious french produced american tax break comedies most of the situations were boring unbelievable stereotypical and so not funny justterrible   one such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene from a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting  not to mention unbelievable  scenario to get these three stranded without their luggagethey are on the holiday of their lives and theyre going to risk it all including a 300 deposit luggage and room to exert their rights to dance on a bus i mean theyre about half an hour away from their destination at least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but no they leave willingly cos they cant take it anymoreand wreck their holidayanyway i cant believe the writers didnt workshop this appalling scenario out i think a ten year old could come up with 5 setups more clever funny and believable  i can go on with many others  the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin the wow man out there goth girl inhaling stuff on the train  everything was just woeful i cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though,0
there was some good build up of suspense throughout the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget we witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you silence would have been golden here there could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering i sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother something tells me theres a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc you decide throughout the film i cant seem to find a connection or for that matter sympathy with the characters perhaps thats because they dont develop one throughout the film character that is there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters overshadowed again by some questionable scenes in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic,0
this movie is a mix of a dark comedy and a drama about two guys who worked in a butchers shop and wanted to build up their own when they finally fulfilled that dream they faced a new problem there were no clients one day by accident one guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butchers business begins they start selling human flesh saying to the clients its just chicken and their business starts to improve human flesh sells good oh i forgot to say something these guys arent normal theres really something missing in their brains   the movie has some nice dark humour scenes but it is in my opinion mostly a drama one that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath what are his motivations to what he does i must confess i was a bit surprised with the ending of the movie because i never expected they could make it without been discovered but thats probably because i see too many hollywood movies what i mean by this is that in hollywoods cinema we always expect the punishment of the guys which do the bad things theres always a morality protecting the good values in spite of we all know that in real life it doesnt happen this way too many times and i liked this movie mostly because of that because it fits in a kind of cinema which is true frontal without fake moralities and which see what is on the other side behind the conventional morality it just happens in independent cinema especially in the european   besides therere excellent performances by nikolaj lie kass and mads mikkelsen especially the first one in the roles of the disturbed guys   very nice danish film,1
the trouble with this sort of lyrical filmmaking is that you either make a masterpiece or a lemon theres little middle ground putting it gently this is not berlin  symphony of a city or man with a movie camera unfortunately its not much to look at either  the problem with this one is that its glib and halfbaked as if michael moore had come on board it doesnt really have anything to say or rather to show us with pictures and sounds koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis this is just a patchwork in search of a point though quite inadvertently the movie tells us more about the mind of uncle sam than it intends there is something profoundly paradoxical about an antitechnology anticivilisation antimedia movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology do as i say and not as i do you just gotta love the yanks eh tonally theres something sour and misanthropic about this episode both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration this time the tone is consistently glum it simply doesnt work over this duration as gustav mahler will tell you  stylistically naqoyqatsi is a mess the whizzy digital stuff is particularly misguided it gives the whole thing a totally fussy overprocessed look and it also undermines the realist nature of the analogue found footage i mean i pity the guys part of the joy of koyanisqaatsi was that it was a homage to the use of optical film but now optical films an historical artifact they have to take on board the digital domain but i dont think they bring it off the digital stuff often looks like video links from cnn or bbc world and with the found footage well the digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just silly and the false colour and solarisation kept me thinking of  ahem  james bond title sequences  ahem odd as it may seem there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by yo yo mas performance its about as unobtrusive as a lawrence olivier voiceover the images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma  philip glass himself is on odd form never expected him to knock off the verdi requiem made me laugh which of course is not the desired response to any part of this movie theres even one piece of music that sounds like brahms  perhaps theyve changed his pills  from our idle questions department is geoffrey reggio actually a hopi indian at all or did he just do a sweatlodge in hollywood hills oh and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier episodes in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies too are part of the global media slushy,0
although im not a golf fan i attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it the historical settings the blatant class distinctions and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout the actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing and i was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow toward the end of this movie seabiscuit came strongly to mind although the greatest game ever played is far less complex a story than that film in both cases the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest,1
is thursday an original film heck no but it is a lot of fun i just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick i was expecting much but what i got was some interesting scenes i really liked the first seen at the convenience store some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well some good performances from young actors paulina porizkova was good and i was particularly impressed with aaron eckhart who has gone on to impress me further in yours friends and neighbours and erin brokovich so if you want 90 minutes of easy going fun go ahead and check out thursday,1
apparently this was an award winner apparently someone had a gun against hisher head and was force to nominate maize the movie  or this must have been a mistake  this is the most unwatchable movie ever made the screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask the little girls run into their hero dad and then runs away from him wtf the hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this  the girls obviously werent trained actors and had no common sense to them they were so annoying and so infantile in the movie it not even remotely comedic hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why i got up and left you cant even listen to this movie without nearly going into convulsions  i can puke a better award winner than this garbage,0
i read ashews comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture   i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised  to address ashews comments  trail street is a very well done western  and randolph scott was in it quite a bit   gabby hayes was funnier than ive ever seen him   the bad guys had very good comeuppances as far as i was concerned  plus  it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straightlaced good guy  hes usually so slimy  in all a good western very well acted and written  i liked the background story of kansas and the winter wheat that supposedly helped it become a state too  i thought the girl who played susan was lovely  cant think why she didnt become a bigger star,1
it may be hard to explain how but this film is a masterpiece perhaps because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry the true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession bogard is amazing and needless to say that venice is utilised as a perfect scenery dark sinking and dreary just like bogards soul and classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings in my opinion a classic masterpiece of european filmmaking,1
this movie had an interesting enough plot about clones and organ usage but it fails as the lead actor is so annoying and whiny you want him dead not that anyone else is very good in it either but when you hate the character that is supposed to be garnering your sympathy the movie just fails to work funny enough it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that mirrors this one with more action and a better cast still though i wont be able to think of anything else but this film if i were to watch it this movie has a super dumb clone that is somehow smart enough to figure something is wrong with his camp where people bicycle at one mile per hour and wrestle for no reason the counselors tell them that when they are ready they go to america but our hero has his doubts so he snoops around and learns the awful truth which sends him on the run from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly he goes on the look out for the man he was cloned from peter graves is in it and so is dick seargent but they add nothing to this movie which looks like something that was made for television on the plus side though when the island comes out the makers of this film can proudly say we thought of it first,0
another black comedy that won an oscar for best screenplay starring george c scott this redefines the phrase tearing a new ahole in this case the target is americas medicare and grand hospital system throughout the hospital patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being changed scott roars screams and blasts away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more his comment about dachau to one of his many bosses is sure to elicit laughs he even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times this is one that has to be seen and heard as the monologues and soliloquies are the key points in the film,1
buddy manucciroy scheider solid in a chance leading roleheads a secret undercover police squad called the sevenups whose tactics dont necessarily follow the exact ways of the law they get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab buddy has a pal from childhood named vitotony lo biancowho swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in nyc what buddy doesnt know is that vito is hatching a scheme using names from buddys check listhe has this book open taking down notes provided by vito but doesnt know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mindto set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two copposers moonthe alwaysvillainous richard lynchand bobill hickmanworking with him when this scheme goes awry with one of the sevenups being killed vito becomes fearful because he knows how buddy can be when hes doggedly after someoneespecially when one of his own is murdered  extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping copimposters trying to get them after killing his partner the film isnt overly complex after the plot is setup and we realize who is the ringleader in the scheming of mobsters scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes its toll on him the film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crimespree against evil mob families can get cops killed,1
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning   david johnathon schaech and tish lori heuring are a couple in budapest on business commitments and staying at a luxury hotel one night they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place where they end up in a threesome all is well until david receives some negatives in the mail and he and tish end up being blackmailed but when some people involved in the deception are found murdered things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track down the woman who may hold the key to everything  whereas the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films this straight to dvd sequel deals with the more wholesome  theme of threesomes and sleazy sex it plays like a porn film a cheap piece of titillation with plenty of hot ta action going on if this sounds like your idea of a good film youll probably like it but youd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store  this tries to copy the original films dark and voyeuristic feel but while it does a pretty good job of this it still cant hold up to that of the originals it has an apathetic story with a dodgy narrative flow and compared to cage schaech comes across as interminably wooden  better than i thought itd be i suppose and better than your average one of these dvd direct sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days but really havent we seen enough,0
this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema by seeing this filmwe can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgysuch a strong and adequate use of soundimage montageand almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life cinema was then not only one form of arts it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war it is said that even picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years audience that time was also different i read that after seeing kurosawas ikirulive in its first release young couple quietly told each otherit is a good film isnt it i thinkcontemporary cinema though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective has lost the most importantreliance of audiencecienma was once really the most popular art from and unlike modern fine arts and contemporary musicgave millions of people hope and ideals in this point of viewletyat zhuravli must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time as city lightikiru and la strada,1
mild spoilers  in this wouldbe satire chaplin set his sights on the evils of german fascism playing the twin roles of tomanian dictator adenoid hynkel and one of his subjects an inadvertent world war i hero and jewish barber through events inspired by both adolf hitler and the marx brothers hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring osterlich whilst finding time for numerous oddly flat setpieces the dictators muchcelebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded underwhelming and unfunny  chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid  his muchmaligned final speech is actually the bold memorable highlight of the piece  but the film simply isnt sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it nor to demand repeated viewings the best gags are away from hynkels tiresome posturing and involve the barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in the gold rush and later with a pot on his head accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop  compared to the directors silent classics the great dictator is slow wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure there is no doubt that chaplin was a genius but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and the great dictator certainly ranks as such,0
wow this is the movie that should be shown on tv at two in the morning on cinemax for all those insomniacs lord knows theyd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie terrible acting the killer is quite far from scary ive seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier lots of unnecessary skin in this film pseudoporn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film i could see a group of teenagers with their parents camcorders doing better work than this i dont think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone,0
a college professor is working on creating zombies and wouldnt you know it things go horribly wrong next thing you know the whole campus is overrun thank goodness theres a pair of ubercommandos trained for just such a situation too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moroncommandos lead by a rapper he doesnt even bother trying to play a military guy he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin wit da homies in da hood the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene the male and female moroncommandos share the same locker room and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties hey if you cant make a good movie at least you can have women in their underwear my hats off to the film makers  so after much discussion of how well prepared these moroncommandos are for the job bosnia afghanistan iraq they all get killed off in fairly short order their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end human or zombie cant tell flip on the lights no moroncommando protocol requires them to walk up to the person making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand and well you know the drill the demise of sergeant major sticky fingaz is especially fun  my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie ive ever seen luckily and again hats off to the filmmakers the hottest babe among the moroncommandos manages to survive her and the female ubercommando both wind up in tight tshirts for the remainder of the movie now this is how a military operation should be performed theres a bunch of running around punctuated my humorous stuff like the ubercommandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves and even though weve seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell theyre good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go  a few other funny bits  the paris hilton gag the can you hear me now gag and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on another chuckle is provided by mr fingaz who cant seem to pronounce the word tourniquet toenokit  overall its somewhat amusing could have used some more interesting characters but for a scifi channel original i was mildly impressed,0
considering the subject matter i thought that this film would at least be enjoyable if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece i was wrong i was still waiting for something to happen and it finished  i thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition,0
i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place it was more about the story the characters and their relationships is that not what films are supposed to be about but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise the actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead john paul clarke but one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology or is this the future of wonderful affordable film making,1
top gun without the inhouse animosity or class or money or cruise an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of nextbigthing actors to market their ability to lead a matine this doesnt really have anything anyone can get their teeth into its a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece barking  dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine particularly the action sequences michael biehn is a firstclass action hero but not a leading man charlie sheen is to all intents and purposes the leading man but never quite an action hero theres a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy 310,0
the chasers war on everything 5 words that i love to watch the chasers war on everything is an excellent australian comedy as the name suggests they wage war on everything they seem to love hitting the politions most of all  the chaser is one of the best comedies i have seen and is the top of the line in australia it is on the australian broadcasting corparation abc which is where some of the best comedies are  it has won the australian film industry afi awards but did not win the best comedy at the logies   last year 2006 the chaser was aired on abc on friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it well they have been moved to wednesday nights at 9pm a heaps better timeslot and the best thing is if i miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can download it from wwwabcnetauchaser,1
170209 more 1969 dir barbet schroeder   for a film that most viewers have agreed is pretty average im impressed by quite how many differing interpretations have been offered of it ive only scoured the web quite briefly and ive already been informed that more is a 19th centurystyle romance an allusion to the story of icarus a plain film full of dull people and of interest only to pink floyd completists its fair to say then that critical reception is mixed i would argue that these wildly disparate readings of barbet schroeders 1969 directorial debut are proof enough that more is anything but a pretty average film  neither is it a masterpiece of course i approached more as i did easy rider and antonionis blowup  as a timecapsule film a snapshot of an era  despite the differences in pace style and content between these movies they all have similar flaws  either vague or downright unlikeable characters acting that seems slightly adrift from reality relaxed editing and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant these movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half way  they are what they are man this in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a souvenir of the experience thankfully more offers several truly memorable images sounds and suggestions to the viewer and this is what saves it  stefan is a young man who arrives in paris fresh from his studies in germany the first part of the film follows him as he falls in with a group of french hipsters accompanies them to devastatingly cool and selfconscious parties and bars before meeting estelle the two characters become sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to ibiza against the advice of his friend charlie this is where the icarus thing comes into play  she is the sun he is pursuing her you may now be able to guess how this all ends  ibiza is an idyll so far away from the bustling urgency of the overpopulated paris that the naive stefan knows he must be on to a good thing estelle remains elusive and erratic and the island has a less desirable underbelly up until now i had cared little for either of these characters and their unfocused pursuit of somewhere to be really free but once the action is pared down to just these two the film becomes poignant quite suddenly during just one single wistful exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they inhabit the place where their volatile love crystallises i went from watching with a fading optimism to being utterly enraptured i cant think of many other films that have done this  the relationship between stefan and estelle is real and human in that we can see it go from lifedefining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel coldness they take a lot of drugs and cavort naked on the terraces the rocks and beaches their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful mediterranean surroundings for a while their situation is the very essence of freedom emotional openness and experience for its own sake but stefan is not in control and this is the downfall of more than just his future on ibiza  pink floyds score is a perfect fit for the exoticism the intimacy and the foreboding of more it is one of the most memorable inclusions along with the mosquito netting around estelles bed and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill which appears on the soundtrack albums front cover a scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is illustrative of the fundamental flaws of the couple  they cannot land without a crash maybe theyve come too close to what they wanted  stefan never makes contact with any family or friends from before his arrival in paris we are left to presume they have no idea where he is while other 1960s counterculture movies dwell on debauchery excess the media and voyeurism schroeder has instead presented us with a story focused upon one man who backs himself into a little corner somewhere in the world and quietly disappears,1
ive got to say that im not a massive fan of troma films granted ive only seen three of them or four including this one but two blood sucking freaks and mothers day are widely reputed to be the best which leads me to believe that all the others arent worth seeing that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day which is a troma take on the overpopular eighties slasher while the film is never particularly bad given the type of film its never particularly good either and by the end all i could think about was why did i bother watching this anyway the plot sees some girl die on a race track and shortly thereafter more people start dying naturally there are a few possible suspects but its hard to really care about anything that happens of course in slasher terms its the gore that is most important and given tromas track record where the red stuff is concerned i was expecting buckets of it there are some decent kill scenes and some of them are gory but its never very shocking which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar its worth noting that theres a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley but the rest of the cast arent worth mentioning the direction plot and its execution are all very mundane and i will say that unless youre a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made dont bother with this film,0
im usually a fan of art and foreign films but when i saw this one my reaction was it must be called experimental because it makes no sense the action is static while at the same time it bounces from one location to another there arent enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man,0
this movie is almost unknown but it is very good in a lonely danish town two old sisters live remembering a far youths when due to a strict puritan education they had to reject happiness lonely then the live in a dignified austerity until babette who flies from paris frightened by the horror of the war arrives in few time she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived a good lottery prize lets her organize a great banquet following the best rules of french gastronomy all neighbourhoods are invited all fanatically puritans they accept but they pact to not show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment as it would be a sin however the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat that they become seduced by the sensuality of french gastronomy the banquet end in a very felt though quietly happiness the love between humans has awaken the miracle of rise the human kindness due to the pleasure of the sense has begun the movie is surprisingly good but it is not for all tastes during most of the movie nothing happens all is so quiet and so peaceful that during many minutes you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the town but as the movie develops it becomes more precious when babette wins the lottery prize after 30min movie the show begins the author is able with a perfect directing to show us how babette prepares the banquet how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one love all told in a quiet delicious way with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting then as the banquet goes by the quality in showing us how the mood of all eaters changes due to the meal only with first shots with impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing in addition the tact with the colours and the photography is also superb almost every scene of the movie is like a picture so work is involved there if you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important this is your movie if you happen to like good meals and just love the good gastronomy probably youll feel amused as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you an oscar totally deserved the only problem is its slowness at setting up the story but i can forgive it i hope everyone too,1
this is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of charles vidor rita hayworth rusty parkercharlie chan in egypt sang and danced with gene kellydanny mcguire anchors away danny mcguire owned a night club in brooklyn ny and was in love with rusty parker who was a dancer in his club along with phil silversgeniusconey island who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with danny rusty otto kruger john coudairduel in the sun played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided rusty parker was going to be his top model jerome kerns music is heard through out the entire picture and the song long ago  far away is the theme music for this musical this film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during ww ii which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time rita hayworth and gene kelly were instant hits and their careers exploded on the silver screen for many many years great musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great classic film enjoy,1
would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word stupid over and over again probably  this is arguably the worst movie ive ever seen seriously there are better movies on mystery science theater 3000 i saw this movie for the first time at a friends birthday party when it was still in theaters even though it was actually with friends and at one of their birthday parties i had to leave i actually had to leave i just excused myself and walked out fortunately some of the parents were doing the same thing so i didnt look like a total jerk anyway this film is awful there is nothing to like about it its painfully as in actually causing physical pain slow and sickeningly literally does induce vomiting unfunny you almost feel sorry for tom arnold but then you dont because you remember he was actually in the movie it really does pain me to even think about it  it was on tv a few months ago and i decided i had to watch it all the way through just once i remembered then why i walked out in the first place and felt guilty for boosting its ratings by even one viewer the gags arent funny the characters arnt interesting its just a senseless mess of pratfalls and stupidity  there is a small crowd of theneightyearold kids who watched the movie when it came out and considered it brilliant if you think that having your face removed piece by pece with an ice cream scoop is brilliant then by all means go rent it but if you have any dignity whatsoever avoid this big stupid mess altogether score 010  maybe a negative 1 actually,0
i hope the writer director editor and composer and lets not forget producer read this because their work was truly incredible on this movie let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times  every second of this movie is touching every scene is classic the acting is real the movie is honest you can relate to these characters as people not actors  this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives the story is carefully thought out and every subplot is intertwined and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside  crispen glover daniel roebuck dennis hopper and joshua john miller as a 12 year old boy give absolutely amazing real performances ive seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie its that good great job everyone who worked on this great job  the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting with the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie ive ever seen  this movie is real its honest its a true movie experience which i will never forget you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore ultimately its about people being people and everyone can relate to that i recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film,1
critics are falling over themselves within the weinsteins sphere of influence to praise this ugly misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which its based minghellas hamfisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overlyepisodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this civilwar love story are they kidding after ms kidman and mr law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small north carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind its a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of neardeath experiences to reunite with his soulmate who cares philip s hoffmans amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to renee zelwegers appearance as a cornfed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of kidmans lonely farm to save the day rarely has a performance screamed of look at me im acting smugness her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin released by miramax strategically for oscar and golden globe what a farce consideration the weinsteins apparently own along with dick clark the critical community and won 8 globe nominations for their overblown failure the resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small less powerful prdriven films become obscure cold mountain is a concept film and an empty bitter waste of time cold indeed,0
bedrooms and hallways is the kind of film that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details and that drama can be great fun too even though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie every one is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film and thats the great strength of bedrooms and hallways that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interestinghilariousfunnysexythings too hope youll enjoy the film as much as i have,1
nothing more than a soccer knockoff of the mighty ducks this film proved to be annoying in most aspects this was one of those times where youre parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they dont have to deal with them for a few hours to say the least my younger sisters liked it but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks oh well at least olivia dabo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time,0
this film is so 1980s and that is what i like so much about it it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great while more and more social programs were slashed young people dropped out but not as far as their parents of the 1960s did young people still went to school they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead nothing effected them not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong but you are not sure why watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society glover is great keanu is great hopper is incredible one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen,1
if you like your films to pull your emotions out of you if you like your films with a guy you can root for and relate to if you like your films in black and white you gotta see this film watch it from start to finish because you dont want to miss a beat it is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen then when the plot begins to unfold you will be on the edge of your seat i know i was my mother told me about this film as our family had some of the same things going on in it as the film does we loved frankie who plays the lead convincingly what ever you think about frank sinatra put that aside in the film he is skinny and he doesnt sing so keep an open mind for the era it was made in it tells a story that is still being told today in homes all across the nation and quite possibly the world please watch if you like older films give this one a try,1
dont listen to most of these people ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love its about jill johnson played by camilla belle who babysits at the mendrakis house and someone breaks in if youre wondering how he got in the house he went through the garage most likely so anyway dont listen to the worst acting it has amazing acting with a great story i think that there are 2 benefits that jill has 1 shes a fast runner and is on the track team 2she got out alive lol  it is a cool movie and quite scary check it out you will be happy with this masterpiece dont listen to the other people on the site its very good trust me i am good at reviewing movies im a future movie critic i totally want to buy this movie and you will too when you see it it is amazingly awesome,1

dont pick this one spoiler alert the plot of this aggravatingly bad movie is four friends are talked into taking the shuttle from the airport by a very zealous driver on the shuttle with them is a rather milquetoast looking business type   shortly into their trip the driver of the shuttle takes an offramp and some lunatic driver tries to run them off the road the end result is they get a flat tire the driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire and the jack slips and the guys fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle its at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a kidnapper and he has taken all the people hostage   now the movie gets extremely slow and tedious as the characters do one lame thing after another one of the men is killed trying to escape  even that lacks any suspense finally it is revealed that the milquetoast business guy is in cahoots with the driver when milquetoast guy kills the other male friend by slitting his throat   there are a couple of attempts to escape by the women milquetoast is beaten over the head with a tire iron  yet he survives   the driver is also beaten and somehow survived a head on collision with a fence at high speed while kneeling next to the steering wheel somehow he didnt go through the window or even get seriously injured with a collision with windshield yet the woman driving the shuttle is knocked unconscious  yet she had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield  he is eventually able to subdue the women and get them to an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking one of the women is killed the other one stabs the driver in the leg with a good sized piece of broken mirror and shootsgrazes him in the head yet he is able in what should be a severely weakened state  severe blood loss two head injuries and a large leg gash to drag her out of the shuttle drag her to a large crate throw her in and get it locked all the while with her fiercely fighting him  now some people admire the message of the movie about human trafficking and how it is going on today this is a serious problem but making an extremely boring movie about the topic does not entitle it to a higher rating,0
the first half of the movie is not that bad actually although theres not really too much depth in the characters the story is somehow funny and generally ok with potential to get better which it doesnt  in the second half things start to turn for the worse not only for the characters in the movie but also for the viewer who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end  the previous user comment mentioned its a love story a road movie a thriller a comedy of errors an 80s movie and most of all its a jonathan demme movie  well please allow me to rephrase that its a boy gets girl story they happen to be driving around in cars the thrill is gone as it is all too clear how things will evolve there wasnt any scene in this film to which one might laugh out loud it does have some slight 80s feeling and yes jonathan demme really was the director,0
where do i start lets list the good things about this movie first  1 mikael persbrandt is great as the gangster thomas this is the only character you will actually care about and hes a bad guy allthogh never does anything bad and is generally a pretty likable guy 2 kjell bergkvist is always great hes a bit toned down here but he is quite funny still 3 the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards good use of depth of field and lights  now the bad this is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever the acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top the direction was horrible a totally meaningless story totally unrealistic characters and events and 15 hours to long during emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed people just started walking out during the course of the screening   theres no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent so i wont even try every clich ever conceived is in there and in all the wrong places im sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life   watch it for a good laugh but try not to pay any money for it   r,0
this film was reeeeeeallyyyy bad was it meant to be a comedy as i couldnt help laughing the whole way through it what a waste of two hours donald sutherland was wooden not that he was alone everyone else was just as badand how miscast was linda hamilton,0
i didnt know what to expect  i only watched it on a rainy sunday afternoon on pay tv  right from the start it drew me in  the music and settings and characters were excellent  i hadnt heard of any of the actors but they all were outstanding  a wonderful thriller   now that ive read other comments on this movie referring to past versions and the book  i will be endeavouring to find out more on this great movie,1
the subject matter of this film is potentially depressing a man about thirty with no job little education three kids from a failed relationship living in his parents house but with a dream of directing feature films but about a halfhour into the movie you realize that mark borchardt has a bottomless supply of drive and ambitionits just that its all channeled into his need to direct movies and nothing else will make him happy the movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum but in the end you come away feeling happy because youve just gotten to know some wonderful people go to see thisyoull end up wishing it was longer,1
i lack cablevision and no longer have directv so being a rural resident i have to wait for dvd releases being a lover of blondes but not blonds i of course not only have barb wire but i have stripperella the complete first season ive not yet found vip or a second season for stripperella i have the baywatch hawaiian wedding dvd i have the issues of playboy that pamela denise anderson posed in i could go on i love pamela there is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying stripperella but there are certain elements that i dislike but live with for other series depict smoking and alcohol consumption too some times but those are my personal peeves and i try not to let them ruin the fun of a series like this for me i too was taken aback by the change in animation style but i adapted however the amount of female nudity decreased and that is a big disappointment as one expects a lot of it in a series with a premise like this but then again i adapted one of my favorite episodes of mork  mindy was when they got to meet robin williams so of course one of my favorite episodes of striperella is when pamela  tommy visit the club and the comparisons begin if there really is a season 2 i hope that i can find it for as a completest i need to complete my collection i recommend this for other admirers of the female form and lovers of blondes hey psst blonde  blondes are the feminine form for spelling blond your software should already know that,1
i just saw princess raccoon at the asian film festival in new york the gentleman who introduced the film congratulated the audience on their fine taste you could be at herbie fully loaded he said with a smug smile but instead youre here to watch seijun suzukis princess raccoon the audience applauded and cheered well let me tell you i would have rather watched herbie fully loaded twice in a row princess raccoon an allegedly whimsical musical based on japanese folklore easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that i have ever seen it is so wretched that its wretchedness actually makes me dislike other seijun suzuki films which is quite a feat  there is such a vast expanse of things wrong with princess raccoon that i hardly know where to start perhaps its worst faults are being both aggressively unintelligible and mind bogglingly monotonous if the reels got mixed up or if half of them got lost in shipping the audience would not know the difference if you dont believe me i dare you to steal a print and have someone run the reels in random order if you can tell me which one goes where i will give you every penny i have  the first third of the film features a mishmash of scenes songs including a cringe inducing rap number and images that dont seem to be related in any way at all horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain adding yet another brick to the immense and rapidly growing wall of incomprehensibility it wouldnt surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any japanese folklore that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards stacked them up shuffled them dealt the cards out on a table and then wrote the script according to their order  about thirtyfive minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene something about a shapeshifting raccoon princess in human form and a regular human falling in love i hoped that this was be a portent of the film being something other than a series of perplexing scenes but no such luck the film continues in the same absolutely baffling manner i wish i had gotten out then but i was trapped in the middle of a narrow row in retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene  im exhausted just thinking about the last couple of reels i spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over every big dolly move swell in music or scene that looked remotely like it was concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll for agonizing minute after agonizing minute it went on and on and on and on finally after dozens of false alarms it cut to what i was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear then in defiance of all reason it cut to another scene how could i forget the completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured urinated on and boiled in a soup hadnt been wrapped up yet  im never going to get those 111 minutes back but you can spare yourself the pain unless you want to taint your memory or future enjoyment of great seijun suzuki films like youth of the beast and tokyo drifter do not see princess raccoon i would have rather spent my time vomiting,0
i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series yet memory of it hasnt faded a bit this would be a natural for dvd reissue it seems to me many of the performers have gone on to greater fame robert hardy sean connery to name a couple though it was a smallish role i still remember judy dench then in her 20s as katherine of france henry v she was very lovely then as now  there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color  is this so who of us would know  virtually no color tv in those days mores the pity no vcrs if so some might have recorded it as a way of teaching english history this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage  what a fine reissue this would be,1
83 minutes nope this thing is 72 minutes tops  if you cannot guess the killer in this movie you had better throw your tv out the window because you aint learned nothing in 20 years of cinematic slasher history  and how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked,0
screened this morning for the press at roma film festival n  io e napoleone is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director virz constantly speaks of the young lead elio germano as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the tuscan accent daniel auteuil is a great actor and did very well as bonaparte its really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too  people like valerio mastrandrea or sabrina impacciatore may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even massimo ceccherini best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows fitted in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the diva monica bellucci sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa emilia in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own umbro accent the script by veteran furio scarpelli and virz himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly its difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion io e napoleone is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the hoax my rating is 810,1
there are no saving graces in this dreadful stagey boring snoozefest which brings to mind the ransom of red chief   even though there are some big stars in this film the acting is almost uniformly terrible   glenn ford normally a laidback kind of guy hams it up with forced emotion   donna reed is so overthetop as to prove laughable   leslie nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible   the son is such a repulsive little brat i found myself rooting for the kidnappers   the only decent performance in this mishmash is the relatively minor role of the butler   perhaps im being too harsh on the actors after all all they did were to read the lines given them in the script ah the script that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach,0
where do i begin walt disneys happiest motion picture lady and the tramp is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical canon of disney animation the sequel however is to say the very least enjoyable i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie it was flameshield up adorable the broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and i was humming the songs for the rest of the night i can if you asked me to still sing all of the songs  but where the movie was really good for me it was bad in a lot of other places the animation was kind of scary at times every time there was a close up shot of someones face i dont know it just seemed scary to me also where the hell was lady she gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs scamp at the end she gets 0 interaction with the plot and her only son  but all in all i liked it compared to the original does it hold up no the songs arent as good still kind of catchy though the plot was a lot less involved lady had almost nothing to do with it and its not as cute as the first one but if you go in with an open mind youll have fun and maybe gasp like it,1
i caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me this was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next alan rickman is an excellent bad guy but this character beats all others ive never been so affected by a movie its been 6 years and i still cant forget closet land,1
in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one  wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two  run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae  i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so but as the series goes on and on ive come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill women shouldnt watch this teens should stay clear of it unless theyre doing book reports on the subject  many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck im trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually  this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way  like to college  i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose  so of course that would make them look even fatter  a ploy fashionatas use all the time bad bad tyra and crew  but to be fair americas next top model is not about full figured models its about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty  and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show  the exmodel giving others who wouldnt have the chance  a chance to enter the doors but after thateverything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program,0
this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date the premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute the acting is terrible the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss yuck what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a best film notation the only reasons i didnt turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker and if the paperthin plot line could really keep going on as is was i was not disappointed by this latter notion there wasnt even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested also i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of resident evil 2 in the movie was that supposed to be filler cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie,0
julie meg tilly is a goody two shoes type high school girl who determined to prove something to herself allows herself to be subjected to the rituals of the sisters a smallscale clique presided over by snooty homecoming queen type carol robin evans the sisters propose that for julies final test she will spend the night in a mausoleum preparing to drive julie up the wall but not knowing that recently deceased illintentioned psychic raymar is interred there and has plans to cause havoc from beyond the grave  while this debut picture for tom mcloughlin friday the 13th part vi jason lives and sometimes they come back is limited by its obviously low budget its what mcloughlin and his crew are able to do with it that counts its genuinely creepy unsettling fare it might have very well scared the stuffing out of me if i were under 10 years of age and even at my current age it still got to me to a degree  some of the effects look cheesy but the decent looking corpses and gore are created by tom burman an experienced makeup effects artist who while tending to be overshadowed by more famous names like winston baker and bottin has a good resume with other films like cat people 1982 and the beast within to his credit  what i liked most about it was a real sense of foreboding and atmosphere an aspect missing from some of the current trendy horror movies being shown in our multiplexes  tilly is cute and appealing in her role having recently completed her debut film work in tex before joining this production one dark night was completed some time before its release to theaters in 1983 where it actually did decent business during its first few weeks the other actors do what they have to do well enough familiar faces in the supporting cast include the equally appealing veteran singer  actress  voiceover artist elizabeth aka eg daily kevin peter hall for once not playing some sort of creature character but who unfortunately ends up with very little screen time and none other than adam batman west the directors wife nancy who would play lizbeth in jason lives appears here as the spacey girl in front of the arcade  its decent blevel horror entertainment maybe too cheap for its ambitions and maybe not that slick hey mcloughlin was just starting out but definitely good for some chills  710,1
this film is so bad its hilarious i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy although i couldnt quite work out if they were actually taking the pss or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent i notice it isnt listed here as a comedy so they must be serious its basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine one scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads then showing each other get out of jail free cards that theyve made also check out vinnie jones accent where the hell is he meant to be from oh and theres a load of naked girls in it too who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned bstards the guy who wrote and directed it  a pee wee herman lookalike with a greeshan 2000d beard and an orange sunbed tan  has for some reason cast himself in the lead role maybe this is part of the joke i dont know actually the more i think about it the more im sure this film is a pss take its produced by quentin tarantino and its possible hes released this in humour as a bit of a laugh it is a total rip off of tarantinos style but just done really really badly it is very amusing though and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic either from being an amusing parody of the tarantinorodriguez style or something that is very very unintentionally funny has to be seen to be believed,0
wow when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for this movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster in the best sense of the term sigourney weaver was better than ive seen from her in years emile hirsch was great and jeff daniels broke my heart i can see how this wont be every persons cup of tea as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family dont get me wrong  its really funny too  at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again i just think if youre open to examining your own life imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you i cant wait until it comes out in theaters,1
reba is a very dumb show you can predict pretty much anything thats about to happen barbra jean is just too stupid its like shes not even a character a show like this should at least have someone who resembles a reallife person i guess barbra jean represents a retarded person keira or whatever her name is reba brock theyre all stupid keira is like the smartest person on the show and shes still stupid everyone is stupid thats my opinion on reba since i have said all i can say about this show ill just take up the next few lines of text by saying what i am currently saying right now and do it until theres 10 lines there reba gets 210,0
stay away from this movie it is terrible in every way bad acting a thin recycled plot and the worst ending in film history seldom do i watch a movie that makes my adrenaline pump from irritation in fact the only other movie that immediately springs to mind is another people in an aircraft in trouble movie airspeed please please dont watch this one as it is utterly and totally pathetic from beginning to end helge iversen,0
i really really dont understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb its simply a huge mess and i have to admit that i actually liked avp 1 close to no story okay i can live with that but at least they got to the point pretty much at once avp 2 does not after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clichs dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didnt care enough to be bothered  after that that crapfest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens or at least pretends doing so and boy is that predator stupid blind and deaf its awful how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me he misses with almost every shot only notices aliens when theyre right in his face or if its absolutely necessary for the script so that he can move where he has to be he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time whats that guy supposed to be after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs stupid predator actions or stupid lack thereof or stupid actions from our heroes  then that thing finally ended to my surprise not only me and my friends didnt know whether to laugh or to cry but everybody i overheard leaving the room was halfcrying halflaughing about those 1 12 hours they just wasted  dont watch never,0
i challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement that is if you can stop looking at her practically flawless face she also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting but not nearly as much as i was hoping for the film is extremely slowmoving and lowbudgeted though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated nearly the entire crew is on suspended animation and the ship moves on auto pilot and the heroine doesnt rescue any of them or bring anything useful back home it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldnt be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end there are also some long but rather tame softcore scenes and a couple of alienripoff monsters that kill about 2 people 12 out of 4,0
aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water including the official love interest marguerite moreau  i would have loved to see this movie play out as akashas power trip aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen she does sensual beautiful and menacing to the power of 10 watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold  lena olin is cast in the ungrateful role of the older woman which is hugely unjustified she looks fantastic and at 46 according to the imdb still looks stunning  the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise weve seen it all before etc  the most heart wrenching is akashas death scene especially keeping in mind what happened to aaliyah after filming  all in all a remarkable vampire movie,1
sometimes theres a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe this is one of those films of course i cant help that im biased im from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i dont find billy crystal funny at all and i cant stand all that english style photographytony scott etc with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent soft lighting i suppose were supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a cubs jersey oh and the plot if you really think about it these guys should be locked up not the bad guys since theyre more dangerous and of course theres the clich of the cops on the verge of retiring but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson centera state building of course its a cool building but its the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house,0
my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie ive watched many movies with my 4 year old and i can take almost anything barney is refreshing after a shot of quigley   the plot dialog cinematography  acting were one step above or equal to a cheap porn film i feel cheated out of 369 that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life i will never get back i will say my 4 year old liked it luckily it was a rental we had to return right away  i just hope that the younger actors careers are not ruined from being in this movie,0
i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is i surely could add various adjectives here but i think my point on this is clear 2 whether to show how a twistedminded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie  this was one of those movies that in a way  did not disappoint me from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end  and i was not disappointed there either   was it a complete waist of time yes which raises your question  why did i watch it throughout well i was trying to fall asleep and i thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that,0
this is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film the direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and patrick swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body  spy vs spy films are not  or should not  be about car chases and shootings the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range  even the action shots are just a clich with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs  yawn  i got half way through and switched off  completely bored,0
mixed group of experts explorers divers and scientists venture a mile underground and go another 24 miles underwater to a spot even more remote where they find salamanders giant albino moles  and some big razorfanged winged computer generated creatures lurking about the cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit and thats all she wrote with this lowaiming effort that even fails to combine action science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels imagine if someone gave the folks at the scifi channel 30 million dollars to make a monster movie thats precisely what the cave is like almost startling in its ineptitude at times full of clichs and almost entirely dependent on the special effects to entertain the only difference is they had more money to build sets more money to polish up the monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who give awful performances anyway otherwise its business as usual some of these movies are still fun to watch this one is not and there are loads of reasons why   1 it takes itself far too seriously and has no sense of humor whatsoever so you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesnt even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is   2 the opening sequence serves no purpose whatsoever other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancy  3 unoriginal looking cgi creatures are not impressing anyone in this day and age   4 utilizing shakycam and quickcut editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy unimaginative filmmaking and why further obscure the action by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as fire and explosion of bubbles it makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even on a nobrainer action level  5 even though it wants you take to it seriously the script is full of clichs the dialogue is awful and theres no attempt whatsoever at characterization casting 25yearoldlooking model types in roles as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers might provide some eye candy but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely straight sorry you cant have it both ways  6 there were two exceptions to the model rule as they did decide to cast an old guy and an average looking joe these were the first two characters killed off   7 for a little diversity they also squeezed in a black guy and a chinese guy strangely neither are given much of a voice in this film and basically stand in the background as whitey discusses what their next move will be insulting   8 furthermore how many movies have to be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure hot white female lead and hot white male lead end up together at the end ugh give me a break already  9 much of the acting was horrible cole hausers performance was completely laughable the other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a soap opera and coasted by using the patented dimpledsmilemakesalltheladiesswoon technique which is the pg13 genderswitch equivalent to mylargebreastsmakealltheguysswoon technique often used by ladies in rrated films either way his performance was completely phoned in daniel dae kim from the tv series lost and piper perabo also stunk up the room with their stilted and monotone line delivery  10 was the ending a joke absolutely terrible please god we do not need a sequel to this garbage  so basically i wouldnt bother with this one unless youve never seen a monster movie before or if youre just really desperate and the only other thing on is the simple life the sets were good the bluetinted photography is ok and a few of the actors lena headey marcel iures tried their best so i decided to boost the rating up one notch to a 2,0
this movie just might make you cooooo the film was well worth the dark trip to town betty renee zellwegeris the lone acceptable soap groupie out there her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof i might even allow myself to get lost in bettys adorable fantasy if it werent for the fact that dr ravells real name is george and speak of the devil looker greg kinnear fills his role very well while charlie morgan freeman makes you wish for his wish to come true wesley chris rock makes you want to tie him to a chair and rosatia texadatakes you back to those luminous gradeschool friendships the sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and loose his name the remainder of the cast fits well never one to do the same movie twice nurse betty is the exception one of these long cold needing to smile about something winter days,1
this is better then the first the movie opens up with sheriff sam then sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the tropicana while jack tags along  people are shot get glass through necks get squished by anvils get stabbed with icicles eyes gouged out head explosions drownings hangings lobsters shoved into faces slit throats freezing to death killed by snowballs arms are ripped off melted by antifreeze icicles down necks hit in face with pots and pans fingers getting bitten off icicles through mouths bitten on the neck exploding people toasted snowballs and shoved in blenders  the snowballs are hilarious they put it into a blender and turn it on then it says that was fun they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt   this is just a great movie then they start thinking of other ways to kill it and the snowball replies thats not nice  it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this  10 out of 10 stars,1
i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in 97 and it still made me laugh out loud its skillfully written kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at bob newhart in this movie and not chuckle youre more of a man than i  for that matter i think the scenes where tom selleck kisses kevin kline where kevin kline listens to the how to be a man cassette and the postalmostwedding scenes w joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie  sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending butfew movies are perfect,1
you know this is one of those emperors new clothes films its like so off the wall and strange that youre supposed to like it if youre really into film well i think thats a bunch of bologna films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts some person has this bad dream perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed remembers most of it unfortunately and then puts it on film and were all supposed to marvel at their creative genius i have bizarre dreams too sometimes that make absolutely no sense but i dont feel the need to put them on film expose everybody else to them and call it art weirdness does not in of itself mean something is interesting true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it if other people dont get it that doesnt make it profound it just makes it incomprehensible bizarreness for bizarreness sake for me is not good let alone great art and comparing tuvalu to delicatesen is like comparing the godfather i  ii to the godfather iiisame genre not in the same league,0
i have read a lot of books in my short lifetime but this is by far the worst i just got done reading this worthless piece of trash and when i finished it i threw it across the room i hated it and let me state the reasons 1the soldier dies why would the author make the soldier die why couldnt she have kept him alive like a good love story author would do i deeply applaud patty for trying to claw that fbi agents eyes out  2ruth gets fired ruth the black housekeeper gets fired and for no apparent reason too she tried to comfort patty and then pattys sob dad fires her for no good reason ruth and anton and patty were the only bright spots in the book oh and the grandparents too 3 the perm yes the perm now you people might think why would the perm upset you well heres why pattys mom asks the girl if she wants her hair done patty says no but the mom calls mrs reeves the horrible hairdresser and tells her to give patty a perm why on gods green earth would she do that why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm only to have her get a perm anyway the mom always pretends that patty has a say when she dosent have a say at all she should be given the worst mother of the year award for the stuff she dose to patty thank god ruth cut her perm off 4 discrimination racisem and prejudious i hate the discrimination in this book they use the word beep too much yesi know that in those days blacks were free but had basically no rights but come on why teach todays children that word it just teaches them how to discriminate people not only were blacks discriminated but the chinese too in the book people refer to mrlee a chinese man as the beep that is really despicable and last but not least jews and nazies i hate the town for spitting on a little girl what was so wrong for her liking anton she is a 12 year old girl it was just a crush like a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old come on this isnt lolita and lolita is a good book not a piece of filth im surprised that this movie isnt considered dirty like lolita is  5 patty going to a reformatory patty should not have gone to that reformatory refirmitories are for thieves and murders not innocent 12 year olds the teacher or whatever she was called patty an ungrateful spoiled brat ungrateful spoiled brat my butt patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never gave a rip about her patty should of got community service or something she did nothing wrong she just helped a friend  6 favortisem the parents played favoritism with their children patty their firstborn daughter is clearly the least favored while sharon the five year old brat is their favorite daughter the dad says that he wanted to take sharon to hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter  7 the dad i hated him he was so mean patty might as well had hitler himself as her father her dad beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so mad youll be caught thinking patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp  well there you have it folks 7 reasons i hate this book instead of reading this book read the diaries of anne frank or anything else because i warn you it is very depressing and it will leave you really mad the only reason it gets 4 stars is because of anton patty ruth and the grandparents,0
lackawanna blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people   its editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen  the music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life the editing made the story more progressive and captivating   i was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably s epatha merkersons  i cant wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer ruben santiagohudson,1
i had to see this on the british airways plane it was terribly bad acting and a dumb story not even a kid would enjoy this something to switch off if possible,0
this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad or both that it didnt matter as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule for those us residents who dont get the horror because you dont follow hockey its like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington redskins jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey it isnt pretty for our european friends think of two great rival football soccer to us clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other ouch nfb of c outdid themselves here  une hommage du maurice rocket richard merci m richard,1
in search of the cheesiest so bad its good movie ive repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films only to be left disappointed and bored at the end not this time my eyes teared up my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie sure hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this  all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of whoopass with a bunch of yeah brothers and whatchugonnados flying from his infamously goateed mouth and while the hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the hulkster in the ring seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick a laugh riot,0
hitch is a lighthearted comedy that will entertain you with some fine performances will smith turns in a believable performance as a cloak and dagger date doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession smith was excellent never schmaltzing it up too much  the best piece of acting goes to the actor dont know name playing this accountant who has fallen for this woman who is out of his league this actor did an excellent job of character development as he listens to smiths directions but in the end just cant help being who he really is  and in the end thats the main message of this film be who you are in love and youll be ok  at the same time will smith meets this attractive lady and the date doctor gets a taste of his own medicine as he slowly falls for this woman dont know her name but she was pretty good too  overall this was a delightful light movie that is definitely worth seeing,1
a man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire and must travel crosscountry to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand a plot line that was later used to fuel hitchcocks classic north by northwest saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the master himself  for any hitchcock fan the plot is a bit too familiar but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades here the likable and charming robert cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters not withstanding a troupe of circus performers a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone  in terms of sheer originality and quality this does lack in some areas particularly the motive of the antagonists however there is some nice chemistry between cummings and his lead lady the much underappreciated priscilla lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by vaughn glaser the best part is the final sequence which perfectly mirrors what hitchcock would use later in north by northwest only this time the climax is atop a statue in new york certainly not his best but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for,1
the sun was not shining it was too wet to play so i went to the movies that cold cold wet date day  the cat in the hat was the name of the flick and when it was over my stomach was sick  mike myers played the cat his humor was lame and kids neednt see this the humor was not tame  the film was like drinking milk from a rabid cow so it is fun to have fun yet the filmmakers didnt know how  this film in short is atrocious the acting was bad the plot was tweaked too much and the humor was surprisingly very crude  it starts with conrad and sally a rule breaker and a future sheriff when their mother has to go to work she gets mrs kwan to babysit possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs kwan is watching a taiwanese court room a la cspan she soon falls asleep and here comes the cat  the film starts to spiral out of control the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun hes got thing 1 and thing 2 who suddenly start trashing the house he improvises a tv infomercial and accidentally slices his tail off and when the cat goes full carmen miranda its not funny possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist and theres a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat  too bad he didnt warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk or chopping your tail off  soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog who has the key to a crate on his collar if the crate is not locked soon their house will be home to the cats universe here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film  the acting overall is horrible mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat saying things like you dirty ho and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata spencer breslin is great as the troublemaking conrad and dakota fanning is cute as sally though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritteraccident waiting to happen alec baldwins slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting ever trying to woo the kids mom who is played by kelly preston and sean hayes is mr humberfloob moms boss and is also the voice of the fish the latter three are also bland  overall if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor cause theres plenty of it and more save your 700 and see something else as the late great dr seuss once said  it is fun to have fun but you have to know how really universal stop theodores already turning over in his grave  like my mom always says curiousity killed the cat the cat in the hat  out of,0
i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating this was a big disappointment this doesnt hold a candle to contemporary zombie flicks like shaun of the deadday of the dead land of the dead etc horror flicks sometimes take a while to get going you have to build up the characters so when they snuff ityou feel some empathy etc but even so theres a full 45 minutes to sit through here even before you sniff a corpse up to that pointits like watching a bad soap opera nothing of any interest or relevance happens and if you are going to watch this for the first timeyou can honestly start watching after 45 minutes you wont miss anything plot wise when things do get going its all very subpar stuff some of the kills and make up are done well others are done very poorly consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wooden acting ive ever seen  this could all be passable if you really believed this was all taking place on a plane but with guns being fired firebombs being let offno pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm yet the plane stays in the air cmon were not all simpletons  oh and does it really take a whole minute for a fighter jets missile to hit a plane that is a few hundred yards away i know its a zombie film and you have to stretch things but this film along with the other main defects listed above had zero credibility one to miss,0
i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film,1
rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine but her impending success as a solo with romantic offers all around has smitten boss gene kelly chomping at the bit terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy with unmemorable musical sketches the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s with hayworth portraying her own grandmother kelly as always dances well but acts with false sincerity when hes serious hes insufferable and the rest of the time hes flying on adrenaline the script is a lead weight not even giving supporting players phil silvers and eve arden any good lines 12 from,0
rarely will anyone deny that hitchcock remains one of the most creative inventive and prolific directors of all time because he is arguably all of these things it takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties saboteur however is not creative or prolific at all rather hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster american pride a certain calltoarms supportourtroops title which was a popular theme of the time with that in mind hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film including but not limited to a logical plot characterization believable dialog and a fluent running storyline   typically hitchcock does great with espionage films only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with the foreign corespondant and the 39 steps but seemingly lost his stride in creating saboteur and merely recycled the same oncethrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems   1 despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across america the only person who recognizes kane is blind  2 at the dinner party kane and patricia dont want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were gate crashers logically what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening besides does anyone need to be reminded kane is a wanted terrorist  3 since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs   4 nobody recognizes himhis face is on every newspaper   5 the spies catch up with kane in the ghost town and assume hes the man freeman sent to work with themshouldntt he have some sort of credentials i know spies dont run around with name tags and photo ids but a secret handshake maybe   6 cop picks up kane escaping from freemans house still seems no one recognizes this guy  7 how exactly does the fbi come to believe kane with no evidence they dont even show kane talking to the fbi the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher  8 when the cops search the carnival caravan how do they know kane is now with a woman the blind man believed kanes story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing kidnapped or even more importantly running with kane why does this movie not employ logic  this is a running list the movie is not exciting the plot makes no sense and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing hitchcock fails miserably on this one,0

i had never heard of the clearing until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest but once we popped it into the dvd player the boredom was only beginning  the story was dragged out for waaaay too long it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie however after that the outline was followed exactly and that made the clearing unoriginal the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victims family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film and i also found that i did not like the ending so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all  the acting was not horribleit wasnt the greatest though robert redford has given much better performances willem dafoes tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie helen mirrens portrayal as robert redfords wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heartsplitting event  in my opinion the clearing is nothing to rave about use your movie rental money on something elselike garden state perhaps,0
beautiful art direction excellent editing and wonderful stories make this some of the best television ever produced the fact that it was relatively short lived is sadly reflective on the state of television i highly recommend snatching these up as theyre released youll love them,1
nickelodeon has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and were screwed  this show promotes hate for people who arent good looking or arent in the in crowd it say that sexual promiscuity is alright by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary carlys friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path which says its alright to be a bch this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10,0
maybe in its day this movie was special but five decades later it seems quaint just another cinematic relic of the dreadful 1950s stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three female gold diggers who set up shop in a manhattan penthouse in an effort to attract wealthy husbands  i dont mind the shallow theme but the films premise is lame and the execution is worse its a romantic comedy but i found little to laugh at the plot point about an extremely nearsighted bimbo is about the only clever element of the story overall dialogue is flat and so too is the delivery and the script structure is disconcerting the plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies its as if the writer couldnt quite blend the ensemble roles the result is a plot that seems choppy  marilyn monroe was a good choice for her role but lauren bacall was too old for the role she played and betty grable with her squeaky voice and awful hairdo was just plain annoying  color cinematography is conventional but there were lots of shots using rear screen projection contributing to a dated look the visuals are made even worse by costumes that reek of cheesy 1950s glamour they are just awful viewers must endure a fashion show a plot point that amplifies how the films director was smitten by those trashy glad rags  and then there is that orchestra in what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some drearysounding tune at first i thought i was watching the introduction to coming attractions but no its actually part of the film and the orchestra plays on and on and on it has nothing absolutely nothing whatever to do with the story what were they thinking  i enjoyed marilyn monroe with her breathy voice as she bimbos her way through the plot but the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles dumped that orchestra enhanced the comedy dialogue and downplayed those gaudy cheesy costumes,0
forget all those sappy romantic movies involving notebooks and liplocked couples who somehow manage to go to the great beyond together after a screen lifetime of oversimplified unrealistic romance forget all those shameless dog gives its life to save its family flicks although i have to admit that i have a soft spot for them myself forget ricky schroeder already displaying his propensity to overact at a tender age now that one was shameless  this tvmovie which unfortunately never seems to get aired anymore is the alltime champion of tearjerkers hands down and a wellwritten and wellacted story to boot annmargret took a big chance in taking this role nothing flamboyant or sexy about her here and thats a monumental achievement in itself based on a true story she plays lucile fray a terminally ill mother who chooses to struggle till her dying breath to find good homes for her ten children instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies frederic forrest does a great job as her husband the goodhearted but unreliable breadwinner whose crippling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for the kids  the film takes us through luciles heartwrenching process of interviewing prospective parents and then watching her kids leave home it also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and of the father  grieving over the tragedy taking place now and the one sure to follow and frustrated over his inability to do more the scene in which the youngest of the children stevenis taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking ive ever watched now i grew up as a hopeless romantic and have spent the many years since then growing myself a harder more cynical shell i usually find more to mock than to empathize with in the sentimental cinematic tripe foisted upon us these days but this gem from the early 1980s still slays me  i really wish that someone with a lick of marketing sense would release a dvd version of this drama among the special features one needs to include the emmy awards telecast the following year am was nominated for this role but the award for best dramatic actress went to barbara stanwyck for thorn birds in what has to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a truly drab awards show stanwyck broke into tears during her acceptance speech and gushed out annmargret i love you which brought annm to tears  one final note the imdb rating for who will love my children is 64 as of this writing however over 75 of the ratings are in the 810 range mostly 10s whatever kind of handicapping system this site uses to modify the overall ratings of the movies listed by imdb it completely misses the mark on this one this one is the weeper of all time and a darn good tvmovie to boot,1
man i never laugh so much this year and its pretty hard to make me laugh while i expected some hostelstyle movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning this filminsidefilm shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us the viewers that mute witness is not a typically horror movie  the main character the mute american makeup artist billy hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina her performance is topnotch her character cant speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensateand oh boy she did a wonderful job her sister fay ripley is the girlfriend or the fiance or the wife of the infilm director evan richards they were both very funny most of the time i wont spoil more but the scenes following the bathtub moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy  the plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment but dont worry such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boygirlfriend,1
to surmise this film involves two actors caine and moran trying to con a gangster the plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout however this normally shouldnt matter as the comedy should carry a film like this there are some genuinely funny bits mostly provided by dylan moran however other times there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie caines character seemed overdone to me especially at the start he continually quotes shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor one could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny overall i would say see only if a fan of the actors involved otherwise wait for video or tv,1
despite its many faults hallmarks 1995 version of gullivers travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swifts satirical classic  largely because it not only includes all of gullivers many travels but also includes the satire thats often overlooked unfortunately the twin problems of the books highly episodic structure and a television budget even a fairly lavish one remain the book is a somewhat rambling collection of travellers tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another but simon moores adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wifes affections has had him committed the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting the lilliput scenes suffer worse here with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces  this has to be the only version where we dont see gulliver pulling the blefescu fleet behind him  yet once gulliver makes his escape the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the utopians of brobdingnag a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left the guestprisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the houynhnhms that hes not an uncivilized yahoo each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is for the most part its a darker set of travels than expected with only gullivers curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness  and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane its in these latter scenes that ted dansons gulliver really shines never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race  being made for television the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down the star cast is certainly impressive and for the most part wellused if somewhat briefly in a few cases  mary steenburgen james fox peter otoole edward woodward omar sharif shashi kapoor edward fox ned beatty alfre woodard kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them its hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this,1
this was a movie that at the end i thought now that was an enjoyable 2 hours i hate spending around 20 not including babysitting  for my husband and myself to have that it was ok feeling  i think i like will smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero he was well cast in this his character was very likable as was kevin james   there were several laugh out loud scenes its also a romantic movie so guys if you want to impress the lady in your life take her to this women will like it as much as any chickflick but i wouldnt categorize this as one there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy i think thats one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie it has romance and slapstick i dont usually like slapstick that much but it wasnt overdone and i cant think of any those scenes that didnt deliver laughs  i definitely recommend this movie the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was i want to see it again,1
master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a womans life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction  while im not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen  the movie begins a little slow but finds its rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie  the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and theyre not clichd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesnt get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least  the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing its one of the best musical scores ever piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win  overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who dont dont miss it  how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension,1
for me north and south books iii is the ultimate tv series of the 80s just spotting all those cameo appearances was highly entertaininggene kelly james stewart elisabeth taylor olivia de havilland robert mitchum even johny cash no series has come close to this achievementhave you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln dick smiths prosthetics made hal holbrocks powerful performance even more so the crafted costumes the jaw dropping locations everything its clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series desperate housewives lost24 but north  south was and still is one of its kind dont miss it only david carradines portrayal of the ultimate villain you may call him just violent husband worths the viewing maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them im so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain,1
the horror of this made for tv film was that it didnt end with this one it spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilotmovie most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting this had none of that if the intent was to make in camp then it succeeded it resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago and failed again richard jaeckels performance as the master chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film campier than the batman series of the 60s,0
this show was incredible ive seen all three and this is the best this movie has suspensea bit of romancestunts that will blow your mind go bobbie great characters and amazing locations where was this filmed will there be more i really liked the story line with her brother looking forward to chameleon 4 and to see how the world is saved yet again,1
oh wow the character shares my name first name nick this movie as bad as the first one if not worse well at least theres an actual octopus in this movie an actual octopus that makes a better appearance in this film by better i mean longer the acting is pretty dry and its hard to sit through just to let you know when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back not only that but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide realising how horrible life is after watching this film really it shows how desperate horror movies are today more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately this film should have been the final straw so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema that could make some actually good modern horror films this movie bites,0
the girl in lovers lane is one strange little lowbudget film on its surface the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix brett halsey who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny lowell brown and the girl carrie joyce meadows that bix meets who would like to look out for him nothing overly interesting happens bix goes out with carrie bix gets danny out of trouble carries father drinks a lot etc until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered her father blames bix pulls him out of a jail cell and just about beats him to death now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bix  until i read the reviews on imdb i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and dannys relationship than was really there but i see now that im not alone it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959 the homosexual nature of their relationship while never openly expressed is still quite obvious their living and sleeping arrangements bixs reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute bixs inability to commit to carrie and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents hes brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that theres more to their relationship than initially meets the eye im sure they exist but i cant think of any movies ive seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one  as for the movie i dont know any other way to put this  its boring as i wrote earlier nothing much at all happens for 90 of the run time the characters are dull and the actors arent good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark the lone exception is jack elam his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching elam had creepy down pat but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic carrie is killed and bix is immediately blamed what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughters death not a lot of logic there and what about jesses confession danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse real tough guy huh why would he confess so easily and after he confesses no one thinks to grab him its awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off in any other reality he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something im not willing to do overall im giving the girl in lovers lane a 410,0
mild spoilers  this movie was filthy and stupid it could have done well without the constant humping and nude sex it was also very profane i think that they had a good story developing but they messed up the whole thing by overdoing it,0
this a haunting piece of workits only ten minutes long but i would sooner pay ten bucks into the cinema to see this than to see any full lenght movie currently doing the rounds it is a simple piece of a mans reflectionhe arrived a young man in this place and was mesmerised by a room and the music coming from itand now here he sitsdying in old age in this place he so fondly connects to his youth the music in it is brilliantthe guitars have that jazzroom twang like neil youngs music in dead man if you get the chancewatch this filmits worth itif rutger hauer made more films like this i think he would get more respect than he getsat the moment you hear him put under phrases like everybodys favourite psychoim sure that is not what rutger would want to be rememered as an actor forhe also directed this filmso in this shows that he a very artistic actordirectora change from the bgrade movies he has been doing since the early 90si hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is one of my favourite actors,1
i dont remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of luminaires lamps almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures even if outfitted with cheesy 70sstyle cylindrical shades to keep with the time setting of the story on one occasion raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mothers house with fixtures in both rooms being taken out yet the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookies office and includes but is not limited to the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horsehead base which is consequently disintegrated and the severe denting of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight later that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot incurring further damage to the plasticcoated shade  while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps one should keep in mind that lamps regardless of their cheap construction or gauche topheavy appearance are still valuable for the illumination that they provide however if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp i would highly recommend this movie,0
a sparkling movie bb is a marvel shes sultry she is a feminist she is still very much in love  the movie features paris in the 50s it is wonderful to look at the sites the cars ds and orly  a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy the music is horrendous it almost dissonates on the other hand it is hilarious but it is probably the only thing amiss at least looking at it with 21st century eyes  the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity it is that sense modern a movie like un elephant se trompe enormenent did it in an 80s way but the basic premise stays the the same  thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity,1
i first saw this when it came out in the theater though only 13 at the time i was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories the technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory  some of the following may have significant spoilers  even as a youngster i knew the premise is silly the rocket takes off for a lunar mission in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew though loose objects float as in zero gravity and because of that the cabin the area with the controls whatever they called it was gyrostabalized to maintain the correct orientation so that when they landed why didnt they land standing on their heads and where at least in nearearth space the rocket engines had to be running continually  with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer when the engines quit the rocket stopped dead in space and couldnt start going until a phd chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer this time the rocket recalled it had momentum and the next thing our heroes know theyre near mars even a 13yearold nerd knew such a minimumenergy trip would take over 200 days  they land find the air was breathable though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen would be too low to do any good they decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire they come armed even though they were supposedly going to the moon where firearms wouldnt be needed  they get a sight of a collapsed civilization encounter stray martians who look just like people develop an anti nuclear war philosophy and those who survive try to get back to the home planet and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth to do that would require such a long orbital period theyd have died of starvation long before approaching their destination  the film it preceded destination moon used real science most effectively even though their rescue with the oxygen tank forgot about the moment arm from the tanks center of gravity to the output nozzle this film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film its on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals and whose engines were always on  the story on this one i considered banal and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes,0
i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out   while i wont go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an 810 for all the reasons you can read in the other users reviews  what i will say is this   the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible its as close to a textbook audience grabber as ive ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes  everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end,1
is this movie as bad as some claim in my opinion yes it is i wasnt going to comment noting that quite a few comments have already been made ranging from awful to not nearly so bad however i cant resist  what do you make of a movie that has on the dvd cover the phrase the real story of ma barker and her boys and the standard any similarity to actual persons disclaimer in the credits im not naive but in this case its a pretty relevant observation regarding this movie  several comments knock the performances they are pretty awful roberts russell milano and stallone have something like 315 movies and tv shows listed between them they can act or at least perform  howeverthe dialog is not to my taste and quite unintentionally funny at times the story arcs didnt seem to be anything but the barest minimum required to string specific scenes of violence and melodrama together  direction and screen writing has to be faulted amyrillis giggles after seeing ma barkers violent temper and finishes with take the girl what ever you think of alyssas acting abilitiessome screenwriter wrote that line or reaction andor some director shot it and said ok thats good enough no need to retake that thats credible one footnote i did pick up my copy for 199 or 299 in a grocery story discount bin the running time is shown as 91 mins and i note that the running time is listed on imdb as 95 mins i dont know what 4 minutes im missing but i acknowledge that if those 4 minutes were of the right sort of person in the right sort of situation my rating might soar to 3 or 4 out of 10 as i saw it 1  10 is what i must vote,0
after reading a biography on the last russian tzar nicholas ii and his failure to secure the armys support i decided to give this film a try  i watched it with a completely open mind not knowing anything about it except its reputation  these are the things that impressed me the most  1 the shots of battleships and the soldiers used as extras more than once i stopped to think if this was done in this time and place 80 of this would have been computergenerated  2 the realism in it from the maggotinfested meat to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend killed for a bowl of soup this movie makes no concessions to the pc cause which thankfully hadnt been invented yet  3 the slow descent into madness of the odessa steps sequence from the first shot when the limbless man appears you get the idea something might be wrong since the overall shots are composed though you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings then an amputee appears and people start falling in dramatic poses still the shots are composed until the cossacks appear into scene and the incredible shot juxtapositions appear this scene is easily worth the price of admission  4 the fact that this movie is 100 unadulterated propaganda then again when rambo fought in afghanistan he also was having something to do with propaganda only a different kind  overall a film marred by a bit of a slow narrative nevertheless metropolis the cabinet of dr caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive edgy movies that are still remembered for their merits today they really make modern movies look boring and repetitive,1
why lori petty was cast as tank girl ill never know her acting performance is lackluster her voice is grating its almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is  there are several modernpop references in the film which i found to be very strange given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future it wouldnt have been hard to make this premise interesting either some better writing would have helped loads  naomi watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered technogeek i think they should have probably switched roles  ill never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a petty fan  try not to see this movie total waste of time,0

this picture was released in may of 1979 starring playboy playmate susan kiger as honey shayne playboy playmate lisa london as ohara and playboy playmate pamela jean bryant as terri lynn in one of the most delicious sec comedies in drivein history a bevy of bouncing young lovelies all come together in a tale of battling bikinied sorority sisters who will stop at nothing to bare everything so what does hots really stand for youre going to have to watch the movie to get the answer you see the girls are having there problems with the society girls on campus that make them out to be nothing but sex craved maniacs therefore the girls set out to discredit the society girls no matter what they have to do to get the job done in addition cut up in this mess is the dean of the college who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they grow out of control i loved this movie especially lisa london i thought her acting was fantastic and im disappointed that she didnt get other acting jobs based on the three playmates alone i give this movie 10 weasel stars,1
i really liked the movie the emporers new groove but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a llama seriously this movie was bad its like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write 10 lines but i dont even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people arent either way just stick with the emporers new groove if you want a funny cartoon llamathemed movie line 10 is this line right here,0
i admit i go more for the traditional vampire tale but this one is a real winner lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours there was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world a good one for all us vampire lovers,1
being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture but this film just did not hold my interest or attention this story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years back these people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them this film reminded me of a film called children of the corn because it really involves children who are being presented to satan and are his instruments of terror there is plenty of chants mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife,0
tenchi muyo in love 2 is the third tenchi movie it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one at the risk of giving out spoilers tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back nothing new there a past love of yoshos is the bad guy that was done in the second movie the battle between aeka and ryoko and is starting to get boring the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy i personally dont know what aic its makers were thinking i gave this movie a vote of 4,0
this show started out okay but then it turned into a nightmare the worst part about it was the contestants most of them were weirdos they did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies in the second season one guy said he that he talked to his pants that is sick and repulsive also no one cared about winning money all they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was survivor or something the men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together the women were the same also i just couldnt take it anymore i had to stop watching it it was truly one of the worst shows ever,0
three words what a pile two words dont bother one word sucked there are zero reasons to see this movie even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie the martial arts the typical aikido are horrible the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his kill move to his victims worse yet is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles how stupid seagals acting was plain stupid but i still give this movie a 6 for acting because of the supporting cast whose villain roles were actually quite entertaining  the plot is just dumb seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time  at no extra charge  and nothing stands in his way not assassins political leaders explosions or even death  i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it no one should bother with this tripe,0
i have to say krasinski is the only reason i even watched this film he is good however everything else about this film is so far below average that its not worth the time and effort spent viewing this film  this film has loads of technicalaesthetic issues namely shot selections framing camera movements within monologue sequences extremely bad editing probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between shots and overall terrible acting except for krasinski  it was far too theatrical in acting and presentation to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this filmwhich is surprising because its all about a bank robbery which should be at least somewhat exciting  how does a film this bad get made and then released and then distributed  kind of reminds me of a c film students thesis project probably not even that good though,0
i too am a house party fanhouse party i is my favorite movie of all times house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the hps and to kid n playthis was supposed to be part of a series reallythere was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veteransyea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie bc its kind of focused on teensbut kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance  you can tell how good it was bc it didnt even make it to the movie theaters immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacybut they should have represented rightthey should have left it at house party 3 i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 199016 years ago and i have been a fan ever since when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking aboutthere was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off,0
if this movie would have been in english all critics would have trashed it the language is extremely bad the scenes are awfully directed and its not at all funny after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts oh on dogs as well the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time of course the public chose jalla jalla while vingar av glas got little attention  what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun i suppose the result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them this was very frustrating maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master  another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together at several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable   and then i have not mentioned the 2dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles   even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it i mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses  im more surprised that the critics enjoyed it they should have known better  grade 2 of 10,0
theres a unique place in the pantheon of john ford films for wagonmaster sergeant rutledge and the sun shines bright it was these three films with no box office names in them that ford didnt have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it john wayne henry fonda or any of the others he worked with not surprising that ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another   ben johnson and harry carey jr a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a mormon wagon train to a valley in arizona territory along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named clegg their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the films plot  had wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by johnson and carey both probably would have had substantial careers as b picture cowboys in the case of johnson it would have been art imitating life johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to hollywood with a string of horses for john ford to use in fort apache ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history   but the day of the b western was drawing to a close and johnson and carey had great careers as two fine character actors  ward bond plays elder wiggs leader of the mormons bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words but hes the leader because of his strength of character not his impeccable lds theology he turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader  in portraying the cleggs ford only had to reach back four years to his my darling clementine they are the reincarnation of the clanton gang and pure evil in fact if walter brennan who after my darling clementine refused to ever work for ford again was willing i could easily see him being cast as shiloh clegg the head of the family as it was charles kemper did a fine job this is probably the role hes most noted for shortly after this film was done kemper was killed in automobile crash he might very well have worked for ford in the future  ford makes the mormons pacifists here and i dont recall that pacifism was part of lds doctrine nevertheless it works here the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the cleggs it takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them i think that this post world war ii film is trying to say that pacifism isnt always the best policy   another carryover from my darling clementine is alan mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe part of that troupe is joanne dru whos doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in red river dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions  wagonmaster is great entertainment and im willing to wager in the state of utah its a pretty popular film,1
this film took up three hours including commercials on the history international channel last night but it felt like three weeks it wasnt the cheap stagy and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of dresden it wasnt that the film is stripped of almost all context surrounding world war ii it wasnt even that the bombing itself was often made to appear as nothing more than a major inconvenience for a goofy love story no it was the wooden featureless characterizations that sucked the life out of the story oh and the fact that if it is possible for a movie to be obsequious then dresden is that movie perhaps a better title would have been dresdenas uriah heep would have experienced it  it is especially the latter point that so irritates was the bombing of dresden a war crime the makers of this movie believe so but in the typically emasculated way that germans have come to approach world war ii they cant bring themselves to say so without braying about peace and no more warsanywhere like theyre mother teresa and also typical of german obsequiousness towards the british in particular there is an unwieldy effort to grovel before britishness while loading all the guilt for dresden on to one person arthur harris  did i say one person well not quite at the beginning of the movie there is an exclamation from the leading character anna with whom we are all supposed to sympathize damned americans she screams while watching as far off bombs fall and a few minutes later a radio voice intones warnings about the american terror bombing being inflicted upon germans  note the word terror got that its really the americans behind the inhumane targeting of german civilians no matter that the american strategy for almost all the war in europe was the precision bombing of industrial and war manufacturing sites no matter that it was the british who enthusiastically adopted area bombing of civilian targets in germanybefore the germans had themselves even targeted english ones no matter that the americans bombed during the day suffering more casualties in the process than the british in order to hit precision targets while the british bombed civilians under the cover of night no matter that the americans essentially were brought into the rafs true terror bombing campaign kicking and screaming against it no matter that most american officials from fdr to gen dolittle opposed targeting civilians while churchill and his generals couldnt wait to do so  no in dresden both the germans and british except for bomber harris are innocent of a doctrine it is intimated created by the evil americans and only the might and power of a love story between a german nurse and a downed british bomber pilot can adequately explain the truth of the atrocity right  oh by the way for the younger and likely less well read readers of imdb the first and still so far only major literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to dresdens bombing was the pacifist novel penned by kurt vonnegutan american pow in dresden at the time of the bombing i guess germanys zdf couldnt find a pretty nurse for billy pilgrim,0
i managed to see the mtv premiere of this movie last night and i needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the d as it has plenty of injokes for those that have seen the hbo series and has more than enough d for newer fans and the mass of soontobe converts the music really shines with the new songs kickapoo which is much better than it sounds master exploder possibly the 3rd best song in the world and dude i totally miss you there are a load of excellent scenes the car chase the rockoff the meeting and cameos including dave grohl as satan i really could go on for hours but i dont want to give the movie away go see it you wont be disappointed,1
david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life this time the creatures under the sea in this extraordinary 8episode trip to all the animals under the sea  the cinematography is astounding bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales but the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it whether it is making models of creatures or those impressive shots of the whales they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it  2001 had some great tv shows to our screen but in contrast to this documentary gem they make them pretty lame but to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment  overall this is the best tv series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best tv series of 2000s,1
harry langdons saturday afternoon is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keatons cops or chaplins the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesnt offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company nonetheless in my opinion its a perfectly charming comedy in its minorkey way and harry is fascinating to watch  for a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the honeymooners or its many spinoffs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under his wifes thumb try to sneak out with a couple of goodtime girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already shopworn when this film was made but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical he was odd starting with the fact that he looked like a middleaged baby who was half asleep any freudians who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this timid pudgyfaced babyman and his stern gently domineering mommywife when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over youd swear youre watching an interaction between a 6 yearold boy and his mama    and maybe thats why harry langdon gave some people the creeps and still does  but hes a compelling screen figure and its not what he does so much as the way he does it in that scene with the coins under the rug for instance harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other carefully like a tightrope walker counting off his paces until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic langdon moved like no one else whether or not he makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of his own where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward himself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big fistfight is taking place harrys costar vernon dent is in the thick of the action but harry is in a daze for much of the time and winds up sort of punchdrunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with his feet on the other while they race through the streets its a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it encapsulates langdons screen persona quite perfectly hes a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action blinking sleepily while the world rushes past its also worth noting that langdon and dent who worked together frequently have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel  hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later langdons style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially here  saturday afternnon and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that langdon makes an impression thats hard to shake,1
i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie it looked like something that would be right up my alley  the united states of leland is a terrific movie it is not one that will leave you with a nice pleasant ending but with a sad empty feeling instead and when i say it will leave you with an empty feeling i do not mean that as a bad thing i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and humans general motives and how they act as parts of society  ryan gosling is perfectly cast as leland he is intelligent yet stoic i like the way that he narrates the film with his journal the supporting cast is terrific as well kevin spacey is very good as always and don cheadle is amazing as lelands teacher and mentor   this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking i highly recommend it,1
hilary was great as julie and pat was once again magnificent as mr miyagi but there should have been more references towards the other three movies i mean come on first off wheres daniel miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and thats it daniel was his best friend and shouldve at least made an appearance in the movie he couldve helped miyagi train juliesan on the flip side the music stayed true to the movie though with a little more instrumentationfretless bassto accompany the wonderfully played panflute it doesnt feel like a karate kid movie unless you hear that panflute thank you zamfir overall a decent movie though we miss you noriyuki,1
unfortunately this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s which were pale imitations of the original the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a legdragging frankenstein in mummy wrappings who exhibits no signs of intelligent life this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy 1932 you will be disappointed,0
my introduction to a lifelong love of shakespeare my brother was 5 and i was not quite 7 when wttw chicago broadcast an age of kings it became a family ritual to watch including the reruns as an autumn series my father used to buy us a rare treat for the midwestpomegranates and my mother would pop corn on the stove wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then although i will never forget the achingly young sean connery as hotspur but do now and they published the scripts in paperback so we could follow along and figure out the language i managed to memorize most of richard iii over that so glad to see it coming out on dvd highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with shakespeare or english history,1
what are the movies i mean what are movies made for shootings killings no they are made for life stories and this is what this movie does it presents how the life has changed between two ages the father and a son the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help  although there is another generation there are some characteristics which remain including the caress for the family  the main subject is in my opinion the love of the son to the father and viceversa  the movie is consisted of only one dialog but that dialog is more than i could ever wanted this movie is a pure art once again after marfa si banii cristi puiu delivers us another beautiful movie well done,1
when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on dvd neither on blue ray absolutely nothing how its possible this could really happen the direction is impeccable the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music its perfect and james franco is hot as hell  please release this master piece and allow it to have its proper life this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance   edvard,1

how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie the lack of script is one thing but the cinematography makes you want to weep a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but its of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden it would be a shame for the industry if he or any in the team for that matter is given money to make a film ever again this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year,0

when i was in 7th gradeback in 1977 i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year later  kristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie well  esther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaksas the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parents affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the title  the best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  the film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd,1
well i had the chance to view this film the other day i didnt know what to expect as i never saw the trailer and such but what i did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to see  i wish i could give it this film a 0 rating the first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene i wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done the actors didnt have any direction there was no real story i read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc but really why should we expose children to this type of film its got poor humor rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80 of its time i am sure a few people in hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs  also how can 39 people give this movie a 10 i mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company this movie should average at 1510 instead of its current 2310 due to the people that ranked it 10 truly sad,0
there have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb the robert taylor film above and beyond flag waving interservice propaganda really if you believe this one you think that the army air corps in the person of paul w tibbits ran the entire show the nbc produced enola gay probably a lot closer to the mark and the bbctv series oppenheimer with sam waterston in the title role  fat man and little boy takes the same approach that the bbc series did but widens it it avoids the gee whiz technology of the manhattan project and focuses on human aspects the personalities involved in the work instead of focusing on oppie it covers a wide swath of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it  with reservations dwight schultz did a good job as oppie presenting a dreamy ivory tower academic who struggles to relate his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context only to have that struggle won by an overriding lust for personal power and glory in the day after trinity it was made clear that oppenheimer viewed himself as a superior being by virtue of his vast wide ranging intellectual prowess in the end that was robert oppenheimers downfall he saw himself as a sort of philosopherking a moral and intellectual superior who could and rightfully should wisely prescribe what was best for the rest of the world re nuclear weapons development and deployment   unfortunately wisdom doesnt dictate the actions of nations or direction of events on a global scale wisdom doesnt bestow temporal power when it tries to exercise such nonexistent power as oppie found when he opposed the development of the super the hydrogen bomb wisdom is ignored and banished by those who really have the power  i found myself faulting schultz character in one way his oppie exposes himself too closely and personally to the manhattan project despite the doubts and fears that tore at his intellectual basis the real oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach at the beginning he would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good the ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to attain that ultimate good and it must be ignored at least until the end of the project when there was leisure to assess the gains and losses oppie clearly did that and it resulted in his controversial postwar statements to the effect that science had now known sin and that was a knowledge it could never lose   while the project went on such considerations had to be pushed aside if he was to maintain his sanity  because of this ambiguity schultz character comes off as a weak frightened little boy who could never have served as coordinator of rapid rupture as oppenheimer unofficially dubbed his post  paul newmans take on gen leslie r groves is fascinating and a bravura performance if possibly a little bit over the top  groves was a civil engineer by training but first and foremost he was a soldier and a general to boot hes accustomed to demanding that things go his way intensely driven a foul mouthed spoiled child who has tantrums at the drop of a hat who reveres his country and isnt too proud to fall on his knees and pray in other words very much like real ie non civil engineer soldiers aka george patton groves mission not only comes first it is his only consideration feelings and egos be damned except for his own of course   groves couldnt admit it but he knew full well that he needed oppenheimer military rank meant nothing in the world of theoretical physicists oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to straddle  again i have to fault the script on this and for the same reason  in reality groves already owned oppie if he didnt oppie would never have been chosen for the post in the first place history tells of many cases where other scientists some as stellar as oppenheimer simply walked away from groves recruitment efforts at one point groves was so desperate that he proposed drafting the physicists he needed  groves attempts in the film to maneuver and control oppie were unnecessary they only exist here as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly  kusaks michael merriman is a composite of several real characters but theyre from a different time frame several research accidents similar to the one depicted happened in postwar weapons research   merrimans radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film but one which is imho necessary and pretty accurate people with weak stomachs will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences theyre all too real  the main idea that comes across but not strongly enough imho is the big truth of the los alamos experience the scientists who signed on were young idealistic and naive as well as talented most were on their first excursion out of the shelter of the campus to them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets or excessive bureaucratic oversight   it was not only their brilliance but their youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb   theres plenty here to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie just the same if you filter out the hollywood bs there isnt that much of it really this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of manhattan project,1
this movie is astonishingly poor it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue waiting for leslie nielsen to appear it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasnt actually a comedy it was meant to be taken seriously what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie and worse still  other people funded it and gave it the green light  rutger hauer obviously doesnt read movie scripts before he signs up either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay  strangely this film is so poor that you find yourself staring at it wondering how it actually got funded and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas intruments speak  spell  the hollywood money machine at its worst funny though,0
i got this movie in a bargain bin hoping for an amusingly bad flick boy was i disappointed except for avon you see the movie is indeed horrible but so horrible it isnt even laughable the plot oh wait there is no plot i suppose you could say its about the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting at the end of the movie the directors decided to either not make any more sense or more likely died and had a monkey finish directing the movie dont read if you dont want the ending spoiled although the ending doesnt really spoil anything the main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors a la enter the dragon and then gets real angry has stupid flashback and hits a mirror the end wheeee  the only redeeming factor of this movie was avons scene hes talking to the rival street fighting boss and says something along these lines completely deadpan do not worry about him anymore sir i have killed him in a sophisticated manner i wined him i dined hm we went to a disco we was havin a lot of fun and then i killed him at which point the boss says good work avon youre number 1 and avon says number 1 alllriiiiight alriiight the scene continues with avon continuing to say alllrriiiight over and over the next scene is of a dead avon floating in a pool intelligent i think not  lastly i own the homeboy version of this movie meaning the title on the box i own is homeboy it shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming this never happens in the movie this man is never in the movie high quality  notei am new to this reviewing but hell yes i am going to keep it up,0
absolutely amazing humor upbeat music and an antiwar message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen  first of all i love how clever this movie is particularly in the vietnam part of the plot its interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous follow that with the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion which leaves me seething with anger at the war and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen wow  also the music is really cool but what is very unique in this musical as opposed to evita or wizard of oz for example is that the lyrics dont tell the story the mood does along with the visuals and betweensongsdialog donna is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood whereas flesh failures has a driving intense beat in a minor key  also i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering now im definitely not going to do drugs not that i ever intended to  all things considered this is an amazing movie the only negative comment i could say is that its sometimes hard to hear the dialog but who cares 1010 stars,1
plunkett and macleane is a wonderful updating of the swashbuckling tradition predating johny depp and his pirate friends the tone is lighthearted with a touch of social commentary but nothing too heavy one could almost see errol flynn and basil rathbone in this  it starts out in low gear with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion but it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways the robberies are grand and stylish with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers the actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit which is fairly hollow theres not much depth to the figures but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesnt matter  muh has been said about the modern music period music tended to the more serene which seems out of place a classical score with celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work but the more modern rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action since the characters are more legend than reality accuracy in the music seems pointless the pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes so it mostly works well i just wonder how they missed adam ants stand and deliver make no mistake this is not a serious film its pure escapism and a wonderful lark tony scott shows some of the visual flair of his father but i dont think we are going to see many oscar nods in his career just yet he seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film with time he may prove to be a name to reckon with his father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director this is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest,1
created by dennis spooner department s was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol based in geneva created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle if a plane landed at heathrow with noone aboard if a man was found wandering around london in a spacesuit if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters you called on department s to sort things out  peter wyngarde played jason king a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases king caught the publics fancy and was later awarded a spinoff show he was ably assisted by american stuart sullivan  joel fabiani  and the delectable annabelle hurst  rosemary nicols  unusually for a 60s show the department was headed by a black man  sir curtis seretse  dennis alaba peters  if the show looked and felt a lot like the avengers it was hardly surprising it shared many of the same writers and directors the colourful titles were designed by chambers  partners and are worth tuning in for alone as was the case with so many itc series the music was composed by edwin astley his theme for department s has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time  predictably the show looks a little sexist and dated now but dont let that dissuade you from tuning in imagine a hybrid of jonathan creek and the austin powers movies and youve got department s  trivia note the episode a small war of nerves features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role,1
this movie was painfully awful most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods walking thru the woods or dancing in the woods more than half at least then two kids who discover two horribly mutilated bodies in the woods return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk  there is no time continuity its day its night its day its really really night its dusk its pitch black its day all the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind really bad the sheriff discovers a five foot claw print embedded in the dirt of the woods and theorizes that a super large alligator may have learned to walk upright really a silly movie with no real motivation written in for the characters might be entertaining for young kids as an alternative to really graphic stuff,0
the comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate i feel exactly the same way that i am very disappointed at how far rick mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on this hour has 22 minutes but now he is just clowning around going places and talking to people he does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses etc he used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more now that air farce is off the air finally thank goodness mercer and this hour has 22 minutes have got to be next in line for the axe just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more its sad really considering rick mercer used to be the funniest man on canadian tv,0
it may be difficult to believe but the basic plot of this abysmal flick has been lifted from hitchcocks perennial classic vertigo to see edward james olmos in the part once played by james stewart is heartbreaking sean young is better but still a poor substitute for kim novak,0
some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not a college professor david norwell suddenly gets a yen for adoption he pretty much takes the first child offered a bad choice named adam as it turns out adam doesnt have both oars in the water which almost immediately causes untold stress and turmoil for dr norwell this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another all centered around adams inabilities and seizures why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out personally i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack bypass this yawner,0
forget any angstridden documentary this film is really an out and out comedy about a 40yerold porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs the only problem colton ford cant sing and the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song yet ford and equally vapid boyfriend blake harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops determined to make dreams come true even funnier is manager kyle who appears to have the iq of a turnip and whose collageninjected lips look like a bee stung him how can grown men be so selfdelusional bwa ha ha as for the documentary the filmmakers dont appear to have any pov and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven very little background information is provided about the three leads such an inclusion might have made the three seem like something other than aging west hollywood stereotypes,0
a heroic young trail scout leads a large party of pioneers along the big trail to the west with indian attacks natural disasters  romantic complications all part of the adventure  as sweeping  magnificent as its story raoul walshs the big trail is a wonderful film as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago with very good acting and excellent production values it lives up to its reputation as the talkies first epic western  john wayne pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role looks impossibly young but he immediately impresses with the natural charm  masculine authority he brings to the heros role he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star marguerite churchill is fetching as a lovely southern belle who slowly warms to the dukes attentions dialect comic el brendel is great fun as a swedish immigrant beset with mule  motherinlaw woes his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer  looking  sounding like a human grizzly bear tyrone power sr vast  repulsive makes a wonderful villain slick cardsharp ian keith is a sophisticated bad guy his famous physical similarity to john gilbert is very apparent here silent movie character actor tully marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train corpulent russ powell as a friendly fur trapper puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use sharpeyed movie mavens will spot ward bond as one of the missouri settlers  what will surprise many modern viewers is that the big trail was filmed in an early wide screen process called grandeur more than living up to its name the picture looks marvelous with walsh showing a mastery of the new technology he fills the screen every portion of it with action notice during the crowd scenes how everyone is busy doing real work which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen in addition the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which blights so many older films it should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive talkies were still in their cradle that walsh was able to use a microphone at all with most of the scenes shot out of doors is more kudos for him  the big trail was not a box office success in 1930 william haines comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent westerns most of the cast slipped into obscurity including wayne it would not be until 1939 when john ford rescued him in stagecoach that john waynes legend would begin in earnest and despite its grand  sweeping vistas it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with hollywood largely as an answer to the economic threat from television,1
this is a sort of hidden gem it has little to no promotion no fanfare no classic status and it deserves all of the above one of the great directors of cinema fritz lang has created a real gem in this excellent western a fine cast led by randolph scott in probably one of his greatest performances the always sturdy dean jagger robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors chill wills slim summerville john carradine barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country it has tense drama sprinklings of humor and great effects its reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it at very least this is a damned good western,1
what ive seen of wolfgang petersens films has been pretty good he knows how to direct action create suspense and get you interested eastwood tends to be great sometimes excellent this goes for both his acting and his directing they both hand in solid work here the concept isnt bad and the catandmouse game works well malkovich performs rather well and his and eastwoods playing off each other adds to the film i suppose this wont introduce anything new really but it never really claims to nor needs to its two great actors each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well and with a magnificent director at the helm really its entertaining welldone and it just plain delivers editing and cinematography are good acting and character writing is as well the film manages to be suspenseful and intense and if you let yourself you will probably be entertained and engaged even if there are superior films out there the pacing is pretty much spoton i recommend this to any fan of the principal actors the director andor this type of film 710,1
this is a brilliant series along the same lines of simpsons following a family as they go through life and problems etc slightly less realistic than simpsons talking baby and dog anyone family guy goes where simpsons or futurama dares not reaching past into the sicker jokes and more racy gags and believe me it works almost all the gags hit the mark and theyll have you in stitchesespecially the random frequent flashbacks when my brother first showed me this i wasnt hooked but after a few episodes i was hooked you will be 2 1010 for a truly brilliant show congrats to seth macfarlane for bringing this show to life,1
were living in sad times today in which it seems like every comedy movie and tv show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap crude or poor humor most people dont know what it means to really laugh at a comedy and these people desperately need to watch throw momma from the train i say with little hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen from beginning to end the comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout dont be fooled by the murder plot the plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about whats going to happen the story involves a young man danny devito who wants to get rid of his annoying grouchy mother anne ramsey nominated for an oscar in a role that was completely flawless in my opinion and does so by killing off billy crystals wife whom crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel i dont want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film but all i can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh fastpaced and genuinely a real treat to comedy lovers and the type of film you just do not see today  12 out of,1
problem child was an okay movie but did it really merit a sequel i dont think it did the original movies only redeeming asset was gilbert gottfried and he wasnt even good in this sequel  i cant really put my finger on why this movie was bad for starters it just wasnt funny even when i saw this as a nineyearold i didnt sympathize with junior michael oliver at all his character came off to me as whiny selfloathing and perhaps most importantly a rebel without a clue he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben john ritter dated for the sole sake of hating them it also doesnt send a good message to kids with divorced parents who constitute over half children in the us these days when the one woman ben decides to almost marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is  and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate laraine newman come back to the big screen she couldnt even save this movie i also found it strange that she was a white southern dbutante whose name was lawanda that sounds more like an africanamerican womans name but of course that has nothing to do with why i disliked this movie  i think the movie didnt work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate along with protagonists you werent supposed to hate john ritters character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting instead he came off not only as a wimpy parent but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days regardless of how well he knew the woman did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents  in a nutshell the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior completely uncalled for toilet humor and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor involving the dog catchers the movie was just a mess and really doesnt deserve a dvd release if it hasnt been given one already it should just rot on vhs along with all the other bad forgettable 90s comedies,0
le cercle rouge is a very good film though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films in all too many ways the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as rififi and grand slam and many others so while director melville and the actors did great jobs it all seems like a case of dj vu because of this i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score  the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together instead of the usual means vogel escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey a career criminal just released from prison both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch apart from that as expected much of the movie concerns the meticulous details in planning and executing the crime i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached mannersomething relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent years  overall extremely wellcrafted and worth seeingif you dont mind that it seems a tad repetitive youll see some fine acting direction and a lot of great tension,1
this is a 100 improvement over the dross of a third movie and its one hell of a good time this is a john hughes movie meets the devils rejects i really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series i thought jennifer tilly played tiffany really well and brad dourif in chuckys shoes once again really makes this movie shine actually theyre the only good parts of the movie i got rather bored with katherine heigl and nick stables scenes its as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day but chucky and tiffany were great to watch and i really liked the black humor to it i thought it made the movie stand out more if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out  710,1
it is beyond me why two million danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible show the dialogue is terrible and not realistic the characters are hollow and simplistic theres a tough man a tough woman and a sensitive man the writers actually say that they have modeled the characters after greek mythology give me a break all the characters are of course brilliant policemen when i have watched this show i have longed for district hill street and nypd blue these are brilliant shows and rejseholdet is a lousy copy this program is a symptom of the disease danish television is currently suffering from,0
i must admit that this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen i thought dennis hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of yeeeecchh if this is supposed to be funny then i gotta look around for a new sense of humor if youre thinking of buying this movie youd better think again,0
ive become a big fan of the carpenters and i didnt really enjoy this movie  i feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didnt let her true personality shine through i wasnt overly fond of cynthia gibbs portrayal especially knowing she decided karens anorexia was suicide which it clearly wasnt although her family was not big on hugs and kisses i thought the movie portrayed agnes their mother as being terrible  i did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier i thought the metaphor sotospeak there was rather effective when the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving which is probably the wrong word as well  overall i feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly quirky sideher genuine personality even as the focus of the film there really wasnt a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia though of course no one can really know and almost made it seem baseless the film was more poorsingerwithanorexia than karen carpenters story in my opinion  i would assume that they changed her husbands nameprofession and all because they couldnt get his permission to actually include him there were some bad terms there but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes on this note i cant recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband  on the whole it ends up as a lowbudget madefortv movie that just isnt very high quality and can be disappointing if youre a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond karens disease i feel that such a legend deservesdeserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice,0

this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans you think manos is the worst movie ever it doesnt even come close to this garbage i dont even know where to begin the russian commander and the rebel chic are the worst actors ever to appear in a movie they make the sister in troll 2 look like meryl streep the goofy faces the chic makes while shes in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed then there is the oompa music during the prison break the totally out of place love scene the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene the fake castro the fact that everybody has either a headband andor a bandanna on some part of their body the goofiest rape scene ever filmed and the worst acting ever put on film this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans definitely the worst movie ever made,0
one of the biggest french success of the year 2002 lauberge espagnole was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a french film it is not difficult to define the reasons of this success this movie made by one of the most interesting french filmmakers of these last years cdric klapisch presents students coming from all over europe and gathered all together under the same roof in barcelona these students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life either untidy either serious or with a sense of humor i guess that if the movie worked so well it is because a lot of students must have recognized themselves in the main characters portraits and especially xaviers  we follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an erasmus student through his eyes xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities his faults an intelligent making with quite a lot of ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety about the world and being an erasmus student on that subject the best examples can be found in two sequences the first one is when xavier asks a woman at university for the papers he has to send to prepare his dea when the same woman informs him about the different necessary procedures all the papers appear on the screen when she is naming them in the next sequence xaviers voiceover confides to the spectator his vision of the modern world now where to find the second example well the scene where xavier has a thorough medical examination during which klapisch films his visions is widely sufficient to speak of itself  moreover the director wasnt really interested by his main characters studies he left this point lowkey he rather put a lot of effort into xaviers private life of course in his love affair with anne sophie but also and especially in his relations with his fellow tenants it is a real friendship story that klapisch shows us with its moments of happiness but also its arguments and its tensions through xaviers adventure and at the end of his stay he will have been initiated into life which will make him more mature the message that the author wanted to transmit isnt difficult to guess you naively believe that you live in an untidy and complicated world you mustnt give up but intensively search to get what you want even if it is difficult  apart from this we could also fear that with the topic cdric klapisch wouldnt avoid a trap the clichs lets be frank about it they are included in the screenplay but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie then the screenplay contains convenient and predictable moments at the airport and before boarding we see xavier shedding a tear after he left his family but fortunately the shortcomings of the script stop here quite funny dialogs and cool young actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole  in spite of its weaknesses lauberge espagnole is to be taken for a success in the movie of young people besides the whole atmosphere it brings out lets us think that this movie is directed primarily to a young audience ultimately the end of the movie and its big success let us suggest that klapisch succumbed to a fashion that goes right for american cinema the elaboration of sequels and indeed the filmmaker currently works on a sequel entitled les poupes russes lets hope that it will be as good as lauberge espagnole,1
this could have been a good movie if more things were explained way too many plot holes to find this enjoyable the ending in particular is off left field spoiler alert how did the kidnapper get back to dundee so fast and dundee shows up at the house in a matter of two minutes way out of wack here how did anna get hold of the money no explanation at all if the pete the cop knew lancaster was in danger why didnt he have a cop at the door in the hospital this and many more questions remain too bad because the premise was there just bad writing and execution  good cast is wasted here decarlo goes from bad to good to bad lancasters character lacks development and dureya is just blah as the bad guy  this could remade with a cohesive story line and better writing of course it would be much more violent with lots of gratuitous sex and everything the editing would be jerky as well i guess so lets leave well enough alone,0
during ww2 in the philipines japanese soldiers are starving dying growing weak and becoming more and more insane a small group of soldiers trying to stay alive have eventually resorted to cannibalism this film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions there are a few humorous parts in this movie but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and eventually to death a very interesting film showing the death and the horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen,1
first of all i would like to clarify that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen i have watched it almost 10 times just because ive wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims it has the captivating essence of a handheld camera recording of a distant nephews seventh birthday it has all the writing of a wwe match and most of all it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk this movie is a masterpiece  the film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken teens in the desert this scene convinced me that i was onto something big when i picked this film from the dvd rack being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a velociraptor yelling the word raptor on the front of it the scene contains such treasures as tomato sauce spaghetti intestines vain attempts at humour and rubbery dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie this movie is a masterpiece  the film contains erratic backdrops and prop use that causes ones mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film an example is when a truck in the middle of the night is parked beside a cliff wall the very next day they find it in an open grassy area the driver couldnt have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an unnamed bipedal carnivore i will explain why its unnamed in a second so my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it the livestock the driver was transporting did it or jim wynorski doesnt think very highly of his viewers hell in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesnt have gutters the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a phone booth and theres only a single street light yet still i feel compelled to watch and rewatch this film just so i can find more things that will make me giggle the next time i watch it this film is a masterpiece  the directing on this film is horrific long extended pauses strange cuts to characters that werent even in the general vicinity of the conversation people discussing things casually while facing the camera and in turn making them face the wall they cant even give the dinosaur a coherent species flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet distinguished by the intensely long fat disproportionate claw this film is a masterpiece  the editing is prominent on this film this is not a good thing i am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap but there has to be a limit sub plots end as abruptly as they began explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to well not being explained at all and an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt you just never know what is going to happen because the film doesnt follow a coherent structure this film is a masterpiece  now im going to just have to mention a single scene the greatest one that occurs near the end this is a spoiler but not really the final scene contains a showdown between tyrannosaurus rex and sheriff tanner it is like the showdown between sigourney weaver and the alien queen in aliens except without all the emotional powerbudgetepic battling it pretty consists of tanner ramming the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery a white bobcat in a space of several minutes through a series of sneakily slipped in cuts the director manages to turn that white bobcat into a yellow forkliftcrane looking piece of machinery now as i said i know that this film is made from scenes from other films but what two films warrant a showdown with a trex in a construction vehicle this film is a masterpiece  this film gets a 110 for quality of film making but a 1010 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself,0
based on the manga comic of wellknown artist masamune shirow this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me  the story is good but the animation is merely ok while it couldshould have been mindblowing the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat  uninspired if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by shirow ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many respects it set new standards for japanese animation and spawned among other things a brilliant series called gits stand alone complex  i consider this worth a rental unless youre a fan of shirow and want it all do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended,1
after a somewhat slow start i thought this movie about the italian occupation of a greek island during world war ii picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours from primarily two points of view   the love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable because i know it happened in various places under occupation penelope cruz played pelagia a young greek girl engaged to be married to mandras christian bale i had questions about the depth of their love from the start but their future was torn apart when italy invaded greece and mandras went off to fight after german intervention greece is conquered and the island pelagia lives on comes under italian occupation during which pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with captain corelli nicholas cage this of course was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands as they got to know their occupiers they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people and sometimes fell in love  often to the disapproval of their neighbours i just finished reading an interesting book about the german occupation of britains channel islands in which this was a major issue once mandras returns to the island pelagia is torn between them  the second background issue is the italian occupation itself which i thought was quite realistically portrayed first was the contempt with which the island treated their italian occupiers greece defeated italy quite true from a historical perspective and was really conquered by the germans the refusal of the town to surrender to the italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a german officer struck me as something that could well have happened and was quite funny in fact i loved the line we would rather surrender to this germans dog than to you italians the portrayal of the italian troops also struck me as believable the italian army was never enamoured of their german ally and never enthusiastic about fighting with them although hitler and mussolini were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt here the italians are more interested in singing than fighting which the german troops on the island simply cant understand and are ecstatic when italy makes peace and withdraws from the war  until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the germans it was all quite well done i thought  it falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish but still deserves praise  710,1
the most positive points in this film were the credits text style and some moments in icets acting the storyline two rival gangs having to fight it out with the subplots of betrayal power and change are well worn plots but in this case painfulvery to wade through the decrepit scenery which added slight believability in places and questionable lighting constantly distracted from any interestidentification with the characters the shine off of the actresss foreheadnose was blinding not to mention other scenes with the same problem not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen a disappointment if you have seen icet in other roles kudos to other actorsactresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction corrupts side kick and the other restaurant worker,0
good actors good director well acted well directed butwheres the movie did they have an script or just improvised it all at least it is a shortlength movie only 80 minutes including credits nothing seems to happen in this film nothing at all a couple of small time drug dealers caught in small time troubles but youll never get a clue of whats happening nor even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie tons of fs and motherfs but nothing else  for the people who love abel ferraras films such as the funeral r xmas is going to be a big disappointment as its been for me what was he thinking about did he really think that this was a good movie and if he didnt then why did he made it,0
the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time theyll convince you its possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately its not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy filmviewing everyone,0
this is the best movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot im not even a troma fan ive never heard of troma before watching this movie  i had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw tromeo and juliet this movie is a dream coming true shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic there are sex violence humor and satire it breaks many taboos  this movie is neither disgusting nor stupid its hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is the music is great and perfectly fits every scene the characters are very believable and the acting is great i really cared for the characters  it is certainly not for tromas fans only its for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that dont dare to do what this movie does  the bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional you either love it or hate it like all true works of art it isnt understood and appreciated by all people,1
this was a letdown in many ways the location filming in ireland though quite beautiful at times cannot save this uninspired flick greg evigan and alexandra paul as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion just arent interesting characters paul towards the end of the film becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an olympic event other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing naked body although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise one is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of t and a the cgi effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals coexecutive producer roger cormans much earlier and far superior film the fall of the house of usher in all its ineffective cheapness any attempt at true tension and suspense and as a result chills are thrown out the window in this low budget bust if you like images of ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary rent another low budget ghost storyif you can find it titled the woman in black and see how good and scary a movie can be this was a wasted opportunity,0
in the line of fire is one of the best thrillers i have seen it builds and builds to a great climax this film really draws you in your heart is beating and you are out of breath from the action the cast turns in strong peformances particularly clint eastwood and john malkovich this film is expertly directed by suspense master wolfgang petersen thrillers dont get much better thn this dont miss it,1
this latterday fulci schlocker is a totally abysmal concoction dealing with an incurable gambler brett halsey who decides bluebeardstyle to pay off his everrising debts by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy widows the fulcipenned script also contrives to incorporate a few blackly comedic elements  which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which wont stay put an opera singer victim who wont stop singing etc  not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of the student of prague  although in this case the two personas communicate via prerecorded radio messages in the end i cant say im surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of mario bavas hatchet for the honeymoon 1970 which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the disgustingly gory but nonetooconvincing effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces with which alas fulci had by then become completely associated,0
the chupacabra according to this mockumentary is a mysterious  creature that has been killing and eating hispanic goats in latin  america and mexico for years one has crossed the border into  southern texas and a cute intrepid cryptozoologist no i did not  make up that word go to an isolated ranch to find one her uncle  was killed by the creature and some grainy video footage of the  monster exists she takes a badass black guy with a gun and two  cameramen for easytoedit coverage and they go ahuntin for  chupacabras ten minutes into the film they find it  the rest of the film has the team of documentarians getting  attacked by the bloodthirsty monster and stilted dialogue at one  point the team runs into a couple of hottie witches who lead them  to the chupacabras nestfor 100 if only the fbi knew about how  cheaply texmex witches could be bought as informants whole  decades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with a  blank check  in the end after the bloody deaths of characters you dont give a  goats patoot about a chupacabra is captured killed and  autopsied the only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the  makeup departments efforts in such a cheap film  the film is shot on video just like bwp yet the cameraman  characters never reload their tapes or recharge their camera  batteries the lead actress here is awful the beauty of the  average bwp was its use of improvisation during the production  here all the lines are written and are delivered like a poorly  rehearsed christmas pageant  the film is tinged with racism as well the only africanamerican  here is a loudmouthed gun nut at one point as the crew breaks  into an abandoned house they find a trio of illegal immigrants who  comically ask them if they are from the ins chortle chortle  the monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit and nothing more for  such a lumbering and awkward beast he is able to sneak up on  the cast pretty quietly whether they have idiotically locked  themselves in a giant cage as bait or cannot seem to get their  only vehicle started  the gore is gruesome but when surrounded by this kind of  stupidity it loses all of its effectiveness i do not know if this was  shot before or after bwp but i can honestly say this is the worst  film ever made in southern texas about a mythical beast pray  there are not any sequels i will start a letter writing campaign to  troma  this is rated r for strong physical violence gun violence strong  gore and profanity,0
i had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm technicolor stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered also closer to the original material  basically all screenwriter n richard nash did was trim change much recitative to spoken dialog and insert a transitional scene or two including a very amusing one for pearl bailey oliver smiths production design is stagy in the lil abnerguys and dolls 50s adaptation mode but it works well for this works folkloric unrealistic quality stereotyping and racism are present but not to a winceinducing degree further for a movie of its time its pretty frank  the adultery violent behavior drug use and selfdestructive habits of the denizens of catfish row are not at all minimized in the telling but there are debits beginning with all that variation from the stage text the loss of so much compromises gershwins brilliance  no wonder the family doesnt like it the reorchestration especially of sammy davis jrs material is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar george knew what he was doing folks you didnt have to mess with it so much and while poitier and dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well theres a huge chasm between the characters singing and speaking voices  youre constantly aware of the artifice what really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere despite all the tinkering it survivesand youd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it if the treatment isnt entirely to the estates liking and it shouldnt be theres still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of gershwins masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius,1
i couldnt eveni meanlookokay  wow  not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit  i can only thinkhow how do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed or even their lives and conartists like the guy who made this get a dvd on a shelf it seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at subway and made the worst thing he could think of  hey guys give me some ideas start with a cornfield and work backwards well youve gotta have actors straight out of high school and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached and boobs thanks guy im sure that you and windows movie maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project,0
i am almost tempted to demand my money back from the video store this movie plumbs the depths of inanity and is almost completely unwatchable i never bail out of a film early but this was painful to view a thorough waste of celluloid my vote 110 it would have been zero,0
johnny knoxville and the boys of jackass go over the top for jackass number two at a press screening the laughter was so loud and raucous it was hard to hear all the dialog the stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before  all of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film and they succeeded if you like this genre youll love this film if not dont bother  some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves and they have no regard for what happens to them theyll do anything to make a stunt work   many critics panned johnny knoxville for a less active role in the first film but not to worry he is front and center in number two and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a number threee  this is a must see for fans of this type of humor  chris sansone entertainment editor fort bend herald,1
this is what used to be called a womens picture and later a chicks flick when times and movies got more juvenile the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too railthin mary tyler moore in leotards if youre of a certain age like me that might still be enough to give it a look otherwise mtm gives another of her typical bythenumbers performances that shes been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was americas sweetheart christine lathi gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type sorry but it seems true ted danson is too young as mtms husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften it and it doesnt happen here allan burns wrote  directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before wrote it as a project for her and she had the juice at this point to get it made there seems no other purpose to it,0
this movie is basically a spoof on hitchcocks strangers on a train which i thought was overrated anyway the plot has danny devito going to see strangers and then thinking billy crystal wants them to swap murders for crystal to murder his mother and devito to murder his wife both devito and crystal are great and so is devitos mother this is devitos directorial debut and its better than the war of the roses,1
ignore the extreme votes about house of wax in no way is it either a 1 or a 10 i will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing house of wax or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated the trailer makes this movie look very promising which is what trailers are supposed to do there is only one thing for sure with trailers if the producers cant cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suckfest but a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good it does not give you much idea about the total package here a little research can be valuable   house of wax stars elisha cuthbert whose acting skills are closer to kathy ireland than to either her fellow canadian sarah polley or her lookalike rose mcgowen and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as jaume in his feature debut these are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of production designer grace walken who was responsible for the look of ghost ship once again walkens work is worth seeing so much so that it looks like 90 of the movies 30 million budget went to production design the rest went to cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film finger cut off lips glued shut tied up and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff bythebye cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in the girl next door about one big pigout away from having a major weight problem  which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew and judging from the what was on the screen this might actually be true it looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit unfortunately whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity the contributions of all these inexperiencedincompetent volunteers amount to less than zero  inexperienced steven windows dp work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like joel negran insert pearl harbor here they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group rather than linger over and showcase the sets window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerkyzoomingbobbing camera work negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts poor lighting an addlike camera and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design not what is needed when the movies only strength is its expensive and detailed sets  chan hayes did the screenplay and charles belden who wrote the original story is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity one saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody insert van helsing here the murders are played for laughs too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six the audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar although her earlier halfbaked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film another comedy highlight was when cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy  the good scenes take place in trudys house of wax a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill conjoined twins and a lot of roadkill which cuthbert gets to bathe in all this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural florida although from the many hills it sure looks like paul hogans country attention location scoutsthe gulf coast is not noted for its rolling terrain the screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection bad pun between the two sets of twins but somewhere during production or postproduction most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere you wonder why it wasnt also cut to reduce the boredom factor  what is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in midproduction that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classiceven with the existing cast what was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax because it is a photographic medium modern film is intrinsically naturalistic almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality here they had a readymade opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization like an impressionist painting the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close of course they would have had to find a visionary director and dp to bring the thing off successfully but everything else was already in place for this to happen,0
ive just watched this again on the bbc channel 4 its not jane austens best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation i suspect the assembly rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown perhaps they couldnt afford the extras also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation ive never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when ive been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the 1819th century in bath  i cannot believe the uscanada reviews they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout the gothic scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly im sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews a propos of nothing does anyone else think that peter firth gets to look more like colin baker a former doctor who or viceversa the older they both get,1
when i first saw this movie i said to myself hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie why not rent it so yeah i rented it and went back home to see it when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shocked  well first of all no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish good thing it had subtitles  second it was nude nude nude since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies you could see my shock when i saw it gasp covering virgin eyes noo  third predictable to say the least but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies because i dont seem to care if its predictable unless its way over the top   fourth how heidi and kike were reunited so cheesy   fifth how the movie ended it was a bad bad ending how mr van der lindes sudden approval to the mayors election was because her daughter knew how to throw the party blah blah i was hoping that he wasnt that easy to accept it the director might have just rushed it   after all of this bashing of the bad stuff the good stuffs are here to come the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all heidis attitude valentina being poetic with words what i really also like about it was the song that valentina made with her girl friend thats all and for the other stuffs that i havent mentioned they were just soso,0
or is this another way below the bottomofthebarrel masterpiece preferably both somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a host of several horrible horror movies that are all but lost again nothing more needs to be explained asked or screamed out loud if you followed closely at my writings about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk then you know whats in store with scream baby scream the title sounds cool its just the weak script that should have gone someplace else even so this is hands down the most dreadfully written piece of cinematic mastery ever worked on film  if you thought this is an early slasher which benefits the average imdb user to write up another comment better luck next time the real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie which supposedly tells of a bluefaced psychopath out to kill and make some ugly facial sculptures on his victims it feels like youre watching another early scoobydoo episode my favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play in and hooray for an actress under the name eugenie wingate for giving us the worst facial makeover ever 1969 has never been this bad but it is  try finding this 30year old rarity at a bargain basement for five bucks it makes the perfect novelty item for going back to those psychedelic days of flower power bad fashions and trashy music interesting note scream baby scream is also listed in tromas film archives on the companys website only time will tell when this reaches the top of the bottom 100 list along with a few more early 70s cheapies gosh knows they need to plan 9 is history,0
i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool i never got the chance to see it though when i went to blockbuster to rent some videos i figured i should watch it after all i did love silence of the lambs and se7en and if you enjoyed those movies you might get a kick out of the cell the whole story concept is very interesting going physically into the mind of a killer i cant imagine the world they live in the acting is actually pretty decent jennifer lopez is the only one i have to say that wasnt that great but she does a believable job i would recommend for a scary thriller  710,1
i hafta watch crap like this all the way through to see if there are any redeemable qualities whatsoever to justify including it in my clients video libraries dont you watch this not even a minute of it unless someone has a gun to your head you will as i did moan  groan at least 500 times and pray that one of the one dimensional characters all played by really bad actors would turn and shoot you dead  even if you are the biggest sandra bullock fan in the world it is not worth even watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears  i want to kick the asses of the sleazy marketing people who put sandras huge picture on the face of this dvd box and have them thrown in jail for mugging me or something like that i really wish i had the chance to read a review of this film before i bought it  please give me a call and i will pay you 10 to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it stinks up the whole place just kiddingplease dont call,0
i didnt personally know karen carpenter nor richard for that matter so i must go by how the movie portrayed her i think a better person to ask about its accuracy would be her brother richard however from what i did see and learn of karen i felt her pain share her sadness and she was a very special person to me growing up i know that i wasnt born until 1965 so i didnt get to know her as much as some of you older fans but i definitely grew up listening to her music and i have fond memories of her music i remember the song about the radio every sha la la la every whoaso fine etc and i remember weve only just begun as a matter of fact i memorized many many of her songs and some people quite a few tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her  i am not joking on this i also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college 19781987 to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987 i developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying karen in the movie the mother agnes was very much like my mother in many ways and i could also feel the pain that karen must have experienced for my mother was often unfeeling critical and disapproving as agnes was if this was true to accuracy the movie was helpful in identifying and getting to know karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through it is quite difficult to portray a persons entire life in 23 hours and recount every single detail perfectly so i would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate i will give this story an 8 though i wish i did know karen personally i would have died to meet her i would have loved to have shook her hand given her a hug or talked to her i feel her warmth and love every time i hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed,1
any gun can play 2 outta 5 stars totally routine spaghetti western starring that guy who used to play kookie on 77 sunset strip the plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to track it down this is one of those lighthearted westerns which means lots of labored attempts at comedy and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences you can tell this isnt ennio morricones work george hilton plays a bounty hunter called stranger but he doesnt leave much of an impression he just doesnt have the style of clint eastwood or franco nero who are able to do a lot with a sparselywritten character the ending is a complete homageparody of the ending of the good the bad and the ugly though its barely amusing enough to be considered a parody the highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes which features actors patterned after clint eastwood lee van cleef and someone else is he supposed to be eli wallach franco nero its not very clear who are confronted by stranger its an amusing injoke for fans of sergio leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados but i imagine no one else would see the point,0
who are the people that star in this thing never heard of them but this is one of the funniest comedies i have run across it should win the putz puller prize for parody the absurd starts with dr jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiendhe is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie pay attention to the hospital pa system in the background rather like the system in mash the final scene with hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years oh and the busty nurse is cassandra peterson who went on to become elvira mistress of the dark   if you liked the mel brooks classic movies blazing saddles etc i suspect youd like this one  damn shame you cant get it on dvd anywhere  its available on dvd now  good thing dvds dont wear out from use,1
the sea inside a film by alejandro amenabar  almodovar has always single handed the flag for spanish cinema for years now out of nowhere came amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning spanish industry now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama well the big ones would be are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag this is the story of ramon sampedro a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the spanish government for the right to end his life the story has the traces of an afternoon made for tv melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades mateo gil and amenabar cowrite in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time liberty there is a few laughs spare a long the way like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didnt make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie it is a heartbreaking experience specially when sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die but when you strip a man of his dreams the film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with sampedro thats for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes dont lie bardem was not granted his second oscar nomination probably in favour of eastwood but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed jammie fox this role reminds me of the great gregory peck in to kill a mockingbird where the acting looked effortless and i reckon bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur i was never fond of his early work but since almodovars live flesh he is on a roll los lunes al sol the dancer upstairs and the oscar nominated before the night falls made him an international star and although he and banderas come from the same almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how bardem has now become a real reference for spanish cinema in the whole world a golden globe 14 goyas jury prize at venice and probably an oscar with permission from the chorus boys amenabar directs cowrite edits and puts music to a high caliber drama he has pull it off what about some science fiction now whose life is it anyway,1
this brass eye special paedogeddon was swamped by complaints  more on that later  when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  sarahs law  following the abduction and murder of school girl sarah payne  in fact its scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after he found out hed been fooled by the shows maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled noncesense  if truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud  the edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims  chris morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile  cue the childs frightened screams  like i said very poor taste   other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs   no one knows this but its a scientific fact   labour mp barbara follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and kate thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel   morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if theyre classed as obscene  the photos included barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head  a dogs body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to john holmes  hey i never said this show was tasteful did i    its impossible to mention paedogeddon without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians  childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject  the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but its a biting satire  perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of britain before they criticise a mere tv show for exacerbating tensions,1
this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people two of whom join the naxalite movement and blah blah it is really just another film about some beautiful rich people trying to decide who they should bed next the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop literally as we dont hear the villagers say a word never mind learn anyones name thus they occupy the same role as the natives in old hollywood films the movie is also dull and the story does not actually get us anywhere  except to various bedrooms we are apparently supposed to admire the artsiness of it all which merely means no good song and dance routine which would not have saved the film of course but might have at least alleviated the boredom  my friend japna was annoyed at the immorality of the whole story not the bedroom bit but the whole pointlessness of the story the message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing,0
a young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as lady macbeth thanks to the mishap of the productions diva falling in front of a moving car a success winning her accolades bettychristina marsillachfinds instead horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways  first her stage manager boyfriend stefanowilliam mcnamarais viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch ropetied to a pillar in his uncles vast mansion keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotchtaped under her eyes with pricking a result if she blinks allowing her to escape betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position when a specific gold chain is found on her lady macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissorsto cap off this nasty scene the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it while not specifically elaborating this act dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victims dead face having nowhere to turn inspector alan santiniurbano barberini playing him cold and bland at darios requestpromises to catch the psycho as betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort the theater director marcoian charleson of ghandi  chariots of fire who would later die of aidsa sad footnote dario revealed in an interview that charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was hiv positiveattempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics and pal miradaria nicolodi darios former squeeze her agent and confident but the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will of course occur in the theater as marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal  i think this is dario at his most savage  nihilistic although he has certainly made later gruesome filmssuch as his masters of horror entries and sleepless would suggest this film really ups the ante in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath his method of forcing betty to watch was admittedly a gag by dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies i found myself rubbing my eyes every time she just has to blinkbrilliantly dario shoots the pricking from pointofview achieving a tormenting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open i like how dario will show the widened eyes of betty horrified at what shes being forced into watching as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink the photographic work of ronnie taylor is impeccable such as the crows pointofview shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer or when the camera travels through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat or the dream sequence where we are taken into bettys memory of an event regarding her mothers death by a certain killer donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present the highlight in my opinion is the peephole bulletfire sequence masterly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim exploding from the back of her head going through a telephone betty planned to use to call for help we even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killerto add to this vicious scene the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in its beak only aspect i didnt care for often pointed out by naysayers of the film is the final ending which i personally felt was a bit unnecessary but i guess dario wanted to point out that betty was indeed not like her mother a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which in a twist relate to why the killer torments our heroine the rock music used during the violent scenes didnt bother me because i felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks needed a jarring thud which heavy metal can often provide,1

i never saw any of the leagues work until early last year  although when channel hopping one night i caught the end of one the series three episodes but last winter i fell in love with the show and its dark eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters so when i learnt they had made a film in which the shows lovable creators met their own characters i couldnt order the dvd fast enough and near on tore it from my postmans hands when he delivered it i was so excited to see what the gents had done and how theyd done it  and it was excellent from the beginning where jeremy michael sheen is terrorised by edward tubbs and papa dyson why didnt you play yourself hes perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous highgate house of horrors know to bernice berating yet another one of her flock to geoff herr lipp and hilary discovering that they are characters which is a great scene the scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable with the gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot david warners turn as doctor pea is fantastic slightly camp and very funny  the league have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion  and the climax of this film where herr lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose  and to witness how its breaking him down is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the gents talent  something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day  and then you have that rather clever ending  where you sit in wonder  with joby talbots beautiful theme music playing and you know youve enjoyed a very clever and funny film,1
grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long its nearing 4 am here and because its norwegian which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now a droll and deliciously wry romp this movie features a man andreas who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself  after an hilarious botched attempt at latter andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny vaginashaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see but of course in fantasy allegory land desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end andreas attempt at freedom and sensuality  jens lien and crew create a simple straightforward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging the similarities in other similar science fiction arent worth enumerating but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some disembowelment and flagellation that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the graytoned miseenscene trond fausa aurvaag is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well despite the fact that the concept itself isnt anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world  polarisdib,1
what exactly is the point of pretending to con people out of things like ski passes and pizza i fail to see a point id not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless   skyler stone doesnt seem to be a very downtoearth or even a nice guy he has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show   the worse thing about this piece of crap is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone but they are also conning the audience who dont have enough time to read the disclaimed that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show  not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life what an lie no one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched but its also one of the most fabricated blatant pieces of bullhit ive ever heard this guy is an   what makes them think that going to all the trouble of for example write and record a song get someone to pain a huge picture of you and two mates get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free what is the point of that its an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow   as far as comedy goes this is bottom of the barrel stuff,0

in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry  great editing at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece  excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz but i guess its acceptable at certain times  two scenes which i must point out are the bath tub and the couch scene  the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition throughout the short i viewed her as a brute but now we see her true reality her mind spoke before her heart need i say more about the bath tub scene,1
the bbcs blue planet is simply jawdropping i dont think im exaggerating when i say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film from familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths next to nothing is left out weighing in at a hefty 8 hours some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film deep blue but i would heartily recommend you give the series a go i dont think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by pixars finding nemo im sure they will love this too i just wish all television was this entertaining,1
this film works on a lot of different levels its a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and nursing homes a love story a musical ive seen uncle frank a few times and every time i watch it im not sure who to go call firstmy parents my wife a friend ive lost touch with   but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your lifeand want to reaffirm the ones that continue expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord im pretty sure they will,1
hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie although i havent seen dahmer 2002 i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind i loved this movie just brace yourself for low budget and no blood its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest my favorite line is  if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives enjoy,1
this is a truly great and beautiful movie the underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child heather graham as joline struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being incessantly beaten down by the real world its not an unhappy movie though  exactly the opposite its a funny movie with a sad side but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy near the beginning of the movie beautiful vulnerable joline confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friends car she reasons with him convinces him to seek help and gives him 30 as a start at the end of the movie he reappears to pay her back explains that he is off drugs doing well and he thanks her i can hear the cynics groaning of course that would never really happen this movie doesnt take place in the real world it takes place in the world we wished we lived in the sad part is realizing we dont live there the happy part is knowing there are people wishing we did,1
my teacher did this movie its a new beginning watch it and you wont notice that it is a romanian movie the old boring style has gone now its something else a postrevolutionary movie it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists they are unique you wont even know that youre watching you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and youll feel every frame dont miss it pay attention to the plot but dont ignore the details they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies you will hear some music at some point its representative for a part of us but it does not represent us please just keep your head straight and leave your body free,1
the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory  thats reason enough for me  she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films huge mansion near the jungle hunters staying around for parties when they arent out hunting zebras and said parties becoming drunken orgies  all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes and emanuelle beds most of them  joe damato did not direct this one he just ripped it off and used the same casts and did anyone notice the subliminal sexual images at the gas station and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes   coherence hardly any but goddess gemser is beautiful,1
i am finding that i get less and less excited about disneys sequels to movies yes i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same but these movies dont even try some examples are hunchback ii and tarzan and jane if anyone has seen the previews for stitchthe movie you will see my point but i digress this movie reaffirms my point the animation is sloppy the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons and not all of the original voices are there i was very disappointed not to hear michael j foxs voice it was so glaringly obvious that the person doing milos voice was trying to sound like fox but didnt come close to succeeding   if it says anything my children ages 10 and 6 didnt even sit through the whole movie,0
i saw this on mystery science theater 3000 and even that show couldnt really make this movie bearable i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but ive seen silents that were better the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes the cameraman apparently doesnt know what a tripod is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is always shaking around i couldnt even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life  update i saw epic movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2 its not the worst movie ive ever seen anymore,0
from the point of budget 25m cad isnt very much when you look at the animatronics puppetry in this film that alone being the reason for the 9 week shoot i was really keen to see this film and had hoped to catch it when it came out instead got it on dvd recently my main problem is its just not funny at all its better than tenacious d which hasnt got a funny bone in its body but this was a truly disappointing film  trevor matthews is a very strong physically performer but his acting sucks rachel skarsten gives what is possibly one of the most irritating and none funny performances i have ever seen the only really big star in this is david scott whos artwork for the monsters is fab his special effects work is the main reason this film is worth watching loved the cyclops and troll and and the prof monster was straight out of the henson library  if you watch this it wont be the biggest waste of time but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy romp dont bother,0

this is a really dark movie noir indeed the title character is smallpox brought into new york city unknowingly by evelyn keyes  she is on one mission when she arrives and on a rougher one after shes spoken to her no longer innocent sister but she herself is not intentionally a killer this doesnt mean she doesnt kill it doesnt mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesnt throw the city into turmoil  keyes is excellent the supporting cast is very good too there are several littleknown people involved in this  the director included dont be put off it is a movie to be reckoned with and how nice to see a columbia picture columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs yet we hardly ever see them anymore,1
terrible direction from an awful script even the dvd looked muddy and out of focus laughable accents all over the map unlike most of the other commenters i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawnout shots of nude or scantilyclad young men usually wet or glistening with sweat looking longingly at each other,0
i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research and find out as much as i could about the man i later find out that he is not in fact a man but an angel sent from heaven with a face like that who could ever doubt it i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should i am proud to say that bells of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local walmart without the receipt which i had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it but his son mike i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old cantacthiswayoutofawetpaperbag block i came to the conclusion a long while ago the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason the only character he ever plays is himself chuck norris no matter what movie no matter what situation he is always chuck norris the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent mike doesnt seem to understand how human emotions work in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter he seems to be extremely happy maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time his actions confused me throughout the film making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris the guy who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the directtovideo screen the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie was an episode of walker texas ranger in which he plays an equally annoying character maybe chuck owes this guy something the other guy which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable was your average christian fanatic i dont have anything against christians in fact i am one but this guy was just too much for me to round out the story you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people friend and a couple of villains who dont seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies all in all the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time on more levels than chuck norris can kick peoples asses despite being one of the worst actors of all time i still cant get enough of chuck maybe he really was sent from heaven,0
the rap the book this movie was based on was one of the most difficult books ive ever read yet i could not put it down raunchy crude foul lewdyou name it it had it it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel ive ever read  well as for the flickit was deplorable i mean tim mcintire as wasco wasco was the baddest muthatalking bout wascomcintire as wasco is like casting tim conway as charles manson  what happened to the main character in the book little arv he doesnt even exist in the moviefast walking was not the main dude in the book why even name credit this thing with the rap none of the spirit atmosphere nastiness or drama of the book was captured in this movie  for me it was not only a disappointment but a total waste of time and celluloid,0

the first official release of world wrestling entertainments film division is a pretty basic horrorslasher movie called see no evil starring kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hardhitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling and lets not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by wwe it goes without saying that after having seen this movie i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time  see no evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up of course a monstrous murderer played by kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early1980s slasher flick with most of the clichs intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany and thats sort of the main problem with see no evil it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next its too generic to be scary  the movies gory no doubt but its only there for the effect the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly the death scenes dont come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventive  and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters arent developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed some cant even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote so when they die it only adds to the comedy because you dont care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kane  as for kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone theres no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre he has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isnt written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work with  now despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film its one of those laughably bad movies that you cant help but sit down and enjoy my main gripe with the film again is that its simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesnt have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didnt it got laughs because its a bmovie and it doesnt help that the directors previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendously  if you dont mind a fun bmovie or funny horror film id highly recommend see no evil if you are a true enthusiast of the genre id wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else,0
john voight plays the title character in this movie based on author pat conroys prince of tides autobiography a fine teacher film it tells the story of a naive pat conroy a young english teacher whose first assignment is in an elementary school on a rural island the only white man on the island he must battle internal and external pressures as he attempts to instill education and values in children who for generations have been systematically denied such things a solid performance that really makes you think,1
yes nonsingaporeans cant see whats the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly singaporeans are the ones who would actually get it but i plead with you foreigner look at the other crap thats been churned out from singapore and compare it to this film its like comparing a mules diarhhoea chunks to a little diamond this film is the first to truly show some the singapores seedy underbelly  something the forces that be pretend does not exist and theres a part in the film where a gangsterahbeng in our unique colloquial ingris curses in 4 languages namely tamil english malay and hokkien well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time the sad thing is that viewers from foreign contries will have an easier time getting their oily little claws on this gem in its country of origin it was banned initially only to be given and rrating and that too with about 20 cuts to it its nice to know you that one of the best creative edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain unadulterated uncensored halfway across the world than in your own nation,1
i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library well i struggled with it olivier seemed far too old not only in his looks but in his acting of the part the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it soon became bored and annoyed by it i still think oliviers henry v is the best version ive seen of that rousing play  tho admit i havent rewatched the beeb version yet and cant recall how it was when first shown  i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet although i enjoyed his much ado i think the beeb version is far better and i wasnt entirely impressed by his henry v but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of loves labours lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb   finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays richard ii and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next what a revelation this play now is for me yes it is splendid but i feel it needs an actor you can emphathise with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi amazing intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was it doesnt show whilst in olivier it did now i note hes also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh so i shall have to watch that to see what jocobi does with claudius im interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes you can certainly see the influence  and now im going to watch it all over again,1
all men are guilty says the chief of the police theyre born innocent but it doesnt last add this bit of nihilism to jeanpierre melvilles fascination with the idea of the crooks code of honor and you have le cercle rouge this code of honor among crooks however is not simply a clich its a figment of the imagination even when film moralists  realistic moralists by their viewpoint romantic moralists by most others  began to make movies on the subject their theme is that it isnt what one does but how one does it we most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor stories where fate fatalism and the code run things   for most of humanity except screen writers and movie directors this would seriously get in the way of living ones life raising ones children and being a good friend this mannered fatalism is something of a selfindulgent notion le cercle rouge is in my view a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home but where melvilles le samourai  criterion collection in my opinion is style dominating story le cercle rouge manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors the point of the movie in my view is nonsensebut the movie itself is a firstclass experience   melvilles hopeless tale of three crooks  cory alain delon vogel gianmaria volonte and jansen yves montand  is based on a bit of wisdom which is maybe attributed to the buddha that all men who are destined to meet willalong with their destiny they cannot change maybe because some believe melville himself came up with the wording if not the thought either way we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us and will leave us recalling the nihilistic philosophies we discovered and loved when we were in high school once corey and vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of jansen we are off on a oneway ride to rob an exclusive heavily protected jewelry story on the place vendome the tension arises because we not only know the french police are after vogel we also realize that some determined crooks are after corey   the great pleasure of the movie for me came from admiring the work that delon volonte and montand brought to their characters and the intelligent ruthlessness that andre bouvril brought to his character the police captain mattei melville hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see see it happen melville establishes his set pieces  the escape from the train the escape from the woods the later shootout in the woods the meetings with mattei and a man who refuses to inform  with intriguing possibilities he builds tension in all these cases by taking his time a rare trait in movie making and an even rarer trait now and melville takes the time to build up mattei as an individual mattei is a rueful experienced man hes a loner he has a set routine when he returns to his apartment  he greets his three cats affectionately he draws his bath and while the tub is filling he sets out food for them i dont know who mattei is destined to meet but i hope its someone who likes cats   nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics in most cases i think its a much harder task to set nihilism aside and to simply live ones life without damaging too many people and thats even more challenging to show compellingly in a film le cercle rouge is a movie which for me tells me little but it is in its own way i think a beautifully put together film,1
congo is another multimilion dollar adaptation of crichtons works like jurassic park the lost world sphere etc the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence ill make this short and to the point the scenery is beautiful the actors well its the best they can do the script try congesting hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and congo falls somewhere below that there were some silly moments like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava and amy raised by humans surrounded by humans yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her what sort of twist of common sense is that which brings me to this if there was an annoying character in every movie amy ranks of one here you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her neat idea but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk congo is worthwhile to see and not deplorable but certainly not a memorable film either,0
you know i always fancy disturbing or strange movies especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in hamburg germany but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst film i saw this year will this comment contain any spoilers  no because i just did not understand this movie but well what can you expect from a flick that was introduced to a festival crowd we the guys from the festival know that not all of you will watch this one until the very end  i like splatter movies and i also like movies with a strong graphical language but this there are a lot of bloody scenes in this one but why what is the director trying to tell us is he saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster who knows  i do not  if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time  watch it but dont expect to think wow i got the message  i did not get it,0
boogie nights is full of surprises nothing quite prepares one for it its soul yes it does have soul whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter with both a wry smile and respect brillantly cast and wonderful character development the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style  the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each b grade human being is brought through crisis into perspective  a sociologists dream case study the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about selfesteem parental love and lack of it attentionlove deficit and its manifestation in adulthood the desperate need to belong something for everyone here almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal  the film works on a number of levels the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur who happens to be watching the film  boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters a rarity it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more,1
and i am afraid that i cannot imagine why it really is a genuinely dire and exceptionally boring film in some ways it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set had been knocked up on a hollywood back lot out of whatever was lying around from the minuscule and unconvincing set snipers seem to be about ten meters away apparently made of plaster to the actors who are also apparently made of plaster with amusing stereotypes painted thinly on top to the oddly warm pool in a frozen cave to the survival of the cast uninjured when medium artillery shells burst a few meters away on open ground and finally the awful script that reads like a training manual more than a film i really cannot say how dull this is even the opportunity to see whether the young james dean survived wasnt enough to keep me watching for more than an hour this really is one to be avoided at all costs,0
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real one could tell that from the two main actresses ms toussaint  ms potts that their relationship on  off camera was genuine it didnt just end when you hear those familiar words cut at the end of a take the show has thought me a lot about life for eg historical struggles tragedies and triumphsrelationshipsevery day situations every household have same situations no matter who the members are it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself now what did i learn from this particular episode  i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  now you know why i gave it a 10,1
i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called inside im dancing i didnt know a thing about it so had no preconceptions before i went in  the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs and live in a home michael steven robertson suffers from cerabal palsy and rory james mcavoy suffers from muscular dystrophy please excuse any spelling mistakes they form a bond as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in carrigmore by themselves they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl romola garai to look after them the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman thats the story in a nutshell but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way in fact being unprepared as i was i found the tears were flowing way too often in fact i dont think ive cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man this film is a huge drain on the emotions both in the fun stuff and the sad stuff the acting is absolutely spot on james mcavoy is my tip for greatness hes a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him steven robertson who plays michael was superb too and it wasnt until today that i found out that he doesnt suffer from cerabal palsy and it was just some superb acting brenda fricker is also in this film and plays the part of the homes manager very well the other great part has to be romola garai she was wonderful as the love interest and i reckon well be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future  the thing that makes this film work is not only the synergies between the two leads but the script which is just so  witty it literally is on fire i still cant help repeating some of the lines in my head even now  the photography is good although very bleak but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland the music is great in this film too as well as the choice in songs the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track hurt is inspired   if i had to sum this film up in one word it would be emotional this film is very very funny and then on the turn of a coin its very very sad i still cant believe that still two days after seeing the film looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry this film is amazing and i hope it goes far although i cant see that as its advertising budget is probably very small   so go see it i urge you you wont regret it,1

big and we mean plus sized big baddie sebastian cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights when sea faring sterling hadens pop is killed how will haden put an end to terror in a texas town armed only with a harpoon   first off this isnt a bwestern there are no singing cowboys no daredevil stunts no interesting action sequences its just an independent movie  you know the ones that use unimportant actors to say important things and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with interesting camera angles  second this movie to avoid compromises one expects that would cause the elimination of trumbos important statements about justice in america and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl is really low budget the main problem that causes is that the acting is really really bad sterling haden is decent enough in tough roles but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west sebastian cabot tries to do a sydney greenstreet as very bloated plutocrat its not a bad idea but cabot does not have the acting chops for it the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul johnny crale has the best role in the film he does nothing with it  third the script really isnt all that trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isnt going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town and the people when up against real oppression tend to back down this is a pretty stale movie message by 1958  high noon bad day at black rock devils doorway  are all westerns that deal with the evils of western society with an eye to the evils of 50s america trumbo in 59 certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments but he isnt doing anything new or interesting with them  so given all the negatives why does this movie get a 4 mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie the relationship between crale and his girl is um fascinating and trumbo while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them just when one is ready to pass out from indy movie boredom will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack  if you dont like trumbo or westerns give this one a miss otherwise try it you might like it more than i did,0
im a huge m lillard fan thats why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasnt in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming its a low budget movie and some of the actors werent really good but all in all i rated this movie 710  the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie  its a good rental  710,1
when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or cant sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years what is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before ok so people in this one need to lose weightmost americans need to lose weight i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk i dont know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence,0
i was recently given this film on dvd as a gift and was unsure at first if it would appeal although one of my favourite actors has a leading role in fact its on its way to becoming a favourite  first of all thankfully its not the same as the book the ending of which i think is excessively melodramatic secondly its one of the best films ive seen about the first world war what you may ask its not a war film true we see no battles or bombardments no trenches no gas but it shows the cost of war the damage done to the lives of the men who fought in it and the impact this had on those close to them  we first see helen sarah miles a baronets widow awaiting her release from a mental hospital all the women in the film appear to be widows some from the war but helens mucholder husband sir thomas we see him later in a photograph was taken ill and died while she was at a party hence her guiltstricken breakdown she is lost and lonely the wire around the hospital grounds evokes pow camps and the trenches like many of the men in the outside world helen is suffering from a kind of shellshock  out of hospital she has to find her feet in the outside world again a world we experience through her eyes as bleak desolate and unfriendly her mother is unable to provide her with any real support herself a widow she has put up her own emotional defences behind which she hides to avoid dealing with her daughters distress like many people especially in that time she seems to find mental illness embarrassing  ledbetter the hired driver becomes a supportive presence and helps helen begin to adjust to life again but she does not realise that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her this is a superb performance by robert shaw ledbetter is a former regular soldier an exsergeantmajor who runs a boxing club and has set up his own carhire business superficially he seems tough and strong dependable but there are cracks beneath the surface he has not really adjusted to civilian life he invents for reasons he later explains a family and home life he does not have he has brutal outbursts with colleagues and affectionless sex getting close to helen  a woman whom even with the greater postwar social freedom he could not realistically have hoped to marry  exposes psychological faultlines that tear him apart these days one might diagnose ptsd  the same is true of the other man in helens life aspiring politician captain hugh cantrip peter egan he is ambitious handsome but also very young tellingly his girlfriend connie caroline mortimer mothers him combing his hair and making sure he has a clean handkerchief before he goes out he is known to both ledbetter and helen the former had served under him during the war and helen had met him in political circles and had thought him a popinjay however he and helen now begin a relationship with helen intending to support his political career financially and emotionally peter egan fresh from his stage success as stanhope in r c sheriffs journeys end makes hugh more than an immature cad there is a revealing understated scene in the back of the car between helen and hugh in which they quote brookes the old vicarage at grantchester she asks of his war experience was it very bad he cannot answer she says well youre back now but his softlyspoken reply  am i sometimes i wonder  is the key to his character as light and shadow flicker across his face we know that there are some horrors that cannot be put into words the disproportionate casualties suffered by junior officers of his sort  straight out of school or university and expected to lead from the front  are wellknown in a nervous speech during which helen reassures him to local political folk at a dinnerparty he reveals that he will stand as an independent no longer as a liberal the party which had taken the country into the war his emotional life is as damaged as ledbetters he cannot easily extricate himself from connie who depends on him emotionally and financially reading between the lines she is probably a warwidow perhaps of a former comrade with a child whose drawings we see on the wall of her home  spoilers  the crisis between the trio builds slowly with a frightening scene between helen and ledbetter in the car and ledbetter listening in to hugh and connie when he is driving them as hugh tries to persuade connie that even as his relationship with helen develops they can continue theirs that he will at least continue to support her jealousy obsession and his belief that he must protect helen from a duplicitous golddigger lead ledbetter to confront her and hugh violently in her home  the ending is entirely different from that of the novel and is better for it it is dramatic but less melodramatic and maintains an unsentimental tone we began with one character recovering from a mental breakdown we end with another suffering one helen one senses is now wiser and stronger than both the men who have been unable fully to adapt to the socalled land fit for heroes to which they returned from the nightmare of total war the new ending is open one feels that she at least will cope with whatever lies ahead without illusions in this it reflects well the reality of the time in which women helen connie and so many others had to pick up the pieces of a world in which too many men had died or had come home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage   well youre back now  am i sometimes i wonder,1

this overheated southern gothic mellerdramer has a few decent moments but is too often spoiled by a novice director piling clich upon clich and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase rather than allowing writerdirector gabel to update inge or williams as a sort of contemporary midnight cowboy meets lolita tearjerker  close your eyes listen to the exaggerated southern accents and try to decide if youre witnessing a feature film or an acting class  full of eager amateurs   johansson is for once tolerable ie less pouty than usual  though by no means good macht is decent though a little too prettyboy cute to be believed and travolta chews the scenery as never before with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint his performance might have been really touching as it is he  and almost everyone else  is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or revulsion kara unger is perhaps best of all had her role been developed beyond a few lines she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination   pic is almost saved by leonard cohenstyle growling theme song decent production design and locations and continual reference to literary works which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as poetic also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny shroyer and perhaps most importantly soderbergh cameraman elliot davis  whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the firsttime director who ten or twenty years from now may actually learn how to direct  but probably not,0
man i had my doubts i love kathy bates but i thought how good can this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it was one of those things we gave it 20 minutes and well turn it off if it sucks and we were locked in from the getgo this is a very winsome fun movie its quirky you know i mean youve got a lounge singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce then kathy bates in all her acting splendor rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan ackroyd and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud i tell ya youll laughyoull cry   maybe i had a weird week but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you dont like that movie maybe you wont like this but i think it was a great movie i went out and bought the dvd,1

what a terrible movie the acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play or a story driven pornography film this is not pornography in this film but there sure is a lot of gratuitous nudity this is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star also there are a million cops that die in this film hardly offensive though since the violence is so unrealistic we can only laugh but breasts pop out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times if you enjoy really really bad movies check this one out this is a bonnie and clyde type story where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge this film also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people i have ever seen rolling around naked,0
i dont know what has happened to director abel ferrara ever since the body snatchers remake he seems to have lost it king of new york and the bad lieutenant remain two of the best films of the 90s searing indictments of a decade gone wrong with films like r xmas whatever that means and new rose hotel he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters this film has no life in it while he gets excellent performances out of his actors in all of his projects the result of this mishmash of ideas just doesnt jell whatever the point is  that the new breed of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other upper middle class new yawkuh  gets lost in the mind numbing script and boring direction   i saw this opening night at the 4plex in downtown la in the lobby while buying tickets i was surprised and delighted to see it filled with a large racially mixed group of men and women in their twenties and thirties then they started into the theater but it was the theater that was featuring 8 mile not r xmas the theater showing r xmas keep in mind this was opening night had a total of 4 people watching it myself my wife and two others   way to go abel  210,0
i agree with the aussies comments for the most part however there id seem to be a fairly decent plot if unoriginal christina kelli mccarty inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge she gets reacquainted with chip bobby johnston whom she had known when she was growing up in there the plot thickens when james paul logan arrives with his new stripper friend shene devinn lane because christina had been james stripper friend in years gone by and the implication is that james had done her wrong somehow to add interest to the movie sophia linn monique parent a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge as do eric sebastien guy and linda flower pair of lawyers from the city james sicks the local building codes inspector on christinas business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down so the question is how far will james go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed  watch for devinn lane here and in beauty betrayed she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the r world another notable is samantha mcconnell playing the role of bait clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies,1
long before terri schiavo brought the issue of living as a vegetable to the public view a day in the death of joe egg dealt with it alan bates plays bri a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost completely brindled he and his wife sheila janet suzman try all sorts of dark humor to try and get on with their lives but they cant escape the facts at one point they even consider euthanasia the question circling them and their friends is what will ever become of this predicament   with this movie alan bates continued his streak of really good movies preceded by zorba the greek the king of hearts and the fixer we can safely say that he will be sadly missed,1
i enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so i wasnt able to watch them all i was surprised when it didnt return and had no i idea why still dont know but i guess thats not important  great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends the two supporting actresses also added well to the mix i guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years later  the characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars  that sort of thing a little woody allenish in a way,1
this adaption contains two parts   1 the now time when gulliver is at home in england and soon is put into a mental asylum by the evil dr bates   2 the described time in which gulliver describes his travels  the times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part and followed the book as written in the book there is no dr bates no asylum and mrs gulliver gets very little mention the travels  in plural  are depicted as one in the movie there are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there look at them if you want that stuff the now time part adds absolutely nothing to the storys value is a complete invention by the movie adapters and takes valuable time from the real story all the time when this was going on i was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown  so much for the drawbacks the parts which actually are part of the real story are well done and the cgi is really well done for its time many small and a few mediumsized parts of the real travels are simply cut out but that does not make the story halt this is afaik the only version which depicts all four travels and for that the movie should get special mention   the two interspersed parts get approximately equal time i rate the first part 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage as 810 averaging out i give it a 410 if only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99 on the actual travels since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels   why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon swifts work i do not know my best guess is that cgi was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets gci etc in order to keep total costs under some limit while at the same time producing a miniseries which clocked in at some set number of minutes,0
this is a difficult movie to watch and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19 pixote peewee is a street kid in sao paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement he is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesnt exist when finally he escapes he and three comrades survive by the only means they know which is crime what makes the film so heartrending is that both pixote and the actor portraying him clearly do not wish to be the characters life circumstances have made them pixote tries to trust and to love and to bond but there simply is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature one is left at the end wanting desperately to do something for the pixotes of the world but what building more childrenss prisons with higher walls surely is not the answer,1
i have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie and i understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about ponyo whether it be the story line animation dialogue and so forth and i believe the most simple way i can answer to this is that its a movie for a much much younger age bracket an age bracket much younger than that of tonarino totoro my neighbor totoro  being a miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site i expected the wonderful animation music composition complex story telling the great steady development of characters how the story intertwines with todays society etc etc etc of a typical miyazaki film that we grew up with and to tell you the truth i didnt quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes with twenty minutes left in the movie that this movie is not for the deep thinkers and hard core ghibliists but for the toddlers and youngins and happy go lucky japanese people also i believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation straightup grass roots ghibli studios style   the fact that a villain is not present really surprised me other than the father and maybe that crazyass typhoon but other than that this movie is just plain fun to stimulate a young ones mind and to make happy good time feeling thats all   the animation goes back to the oldschool mid80s early90s era of miyazakis films where very specific detail wasnt a big focus unlike mononoke hime princess mononoke and the latter i admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when i first watched ghibli movies like tonarino totoro when i was a child the reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids and a lot of studio ghiblis body language is very noticeable studio ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with its wonderful animators but it probably wont take the ritual ghibliist in awe  the japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very very relative from what japanese kids and mothers would say and act the music if very hoppy and fluffy i guess you could say similar to totoro from beginning to end even the darker scenes didnt seem assertive  in the end this movie is one of a kind just about every aspect of this movie is for children and i waited a whole 80 mins to realize that quite frankly i have never seen a movie told or shown it the way miyazaki did its refreshing to see that studio ghibli can still tell a story for a wider and much different scale of audience and still keep that trademark ghibli impression,1
i was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in new york it is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of september 11th this film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days the film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people i walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello i would recommend everyone see this documentary i would rate this movie with an a see it if you get a chance,1
first off this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise you dont know what to feel so much so that you dont feel bad for caines character when his son gets murdered which was actually mostly due to bad editing the script was too bland none of the situations matter as you watch them the soundtrack or lack there of if there was it wasnt good enough to even remember does not help it one bit only good surprise to this movie was andy serkis performance it was on par if not better than caines the story would have probably gone better off if serkis would have killed him because quite frankly you dont feel any kind of redemption in the climax just a feeling of lack of feeling if ya feel me basically this movie massively lacks draw leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing,0
first off im amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to imdb and jacking up the rating but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76 approval rating it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity i mean this film is simply awful the acting is simply terrible but the rest of the film is worse at least the acting provides some unintentional laughs   the plot involves a teenage skateboarding boy who is being questioned along with his friends for a murder that happened by a park where they skate and thats about it the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible acting terrible dialog slow motion shots of people walking of peoples faces of people skating often set to music that does not fit the scene perhaps that was done to be cool or experimental or hip or perhaps it was done in hopes that it would fool people into thinking that it is somehow profound but it does not work nothing in this film works its pretentious garbage i cant not recommend it enough,0
set in the near future a dark stranger walks into some southern american city plagued by zombies settling with a group of friendly face inhabitants our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life there are two groups of people the upper classes who dwell safely behind the concrete walls of the city being provided by at the right price the state police then there are our friendly face inhabitants these lower class folks live along side the zombies there only means of survival is to trade goods which they forage for during the day with the police in exchange for tins of food our stranger discovers why his world is plague by zombies a new dietary pill that suppressed the craving for carbohydrates was the foundation the human races desire to shed fat caused the down fall of society as we know it these pills increased the desire for protein ie meat even the pet poodle however there was one more grave side affect after death people became reanimated with an even stronger craving for protein namely human flesh  with what i feel is an imaginative introduction i felt that this film many realise some inventive material what better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of peoples desire to make any sacrifice to change their body without the hard work of the gym however the imagination of this film soon stopped after this exposition this film falls into the old trap of i can not imagine what the world will be like when society collapses when you watch this film you do not escape to a different world as you do when you watch planet of the apes original alien mad max or texas chain saw original in this film the alternate society is define by people with hair dyed orange and green face paint and charity shop leather jackets there is no harshness about life in this alternate society just healthy faces and over madeup zombies films should allow you to escape not remind you that you need to clear out your wardrobe and take your old cloths to the charity shop  forget about some of the pitiful acting or the over madeup zombies this film fails because it is too polished too congenial and too predictable i have watch films like this since the early eighties if you are going the make a film of this nature i suggest you need to watch again such films as dawn of the dead original and remake threads or fulcis zombie to see and experience that feeling of desperation in a devastate society,0
seriously youve just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it it came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy the little rascals mr nanny etc yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm every single character in the movie is driven by rage with the exception of trixies mother who shows only aggravation and weariness possibly at the tired clichs this movie enjoys   to put it simply the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting nor the filming but most notably the writing the lines we receive are reminiscent of disney classics although this film lacks the wholeheartedness il walt managed to pull off juniors dad john ritter makes you mad without even doing anything simply because he allows junior to run around unsupervised and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200pound behemoth to a chalk board   also juniors grandfather is particularly excruciating for those of you who saw the first one found it nauseating and thus did not see the second one big ben healy as he is referred to in this movie is still a total douche he basically barges into john ritters house uninvited settles himself in juniors room even though he says that he hates junior and basically does nothing to accelerate the films speed or to support the film in any way rather he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader  finally we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters such as the smug obnoxious trixie who carries dynamite in her backpack which she first lights then hands to junior who simply stares wide eyed at also gilbert gottfried returns in this film this time playing the obnoxious principal at juniors new elementary school if gilbert gottfried aint enough to get the point across i will put it simply this film reeks  210 stars because the actors convictions shine through the film even though the script sucks,0
while my kids enjoyed the movie and announced afterward that they want to buy it later i think i got more out of it that they did the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life i did not use the cutting comment aloud but i thought it it is a feel good midlife movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others why does the kid stay with bruce willis after he knows his mom is dying but all in all and good time it also gave our family something to talk about  did my kids think my life was boring what do they expect at 40 how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids,1
this twocharacter drama is extremely wellacted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments shocking not because they are graphic but because youre not prepared for them when they come but eventually it does become oppressive just like the somewhat similar a pure formality did still alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multidimensional performance no doubt about it 12,1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences its not like its the usual done and tried path the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech he needs to take on some more serious roles he is worth more than just teen movies etch this movie and get liberated,1
is it a poorly acted clicheridden pile of trash of course anyone who doesnt realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesnt have any right judging movies in the first place thus i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10  violence and gore 4  for this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost nonexistent anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a little  suspense 1  okay i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids  nuditysex 7  lots of boobage from three different women one of whom is the mtv vj julie brown there are two sex scenes but little is shown in them  unintentional humor  4  there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all its just bad not funny bad  overall  4  its not unwatchable there are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie however only watch this movie if youre a big fan of the 80s slasher flicks this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but its not all the way at the bottom the real downside is the disappointing ending it almost ruined the movie for me,0
soderbergh is a fabulous director but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels clearly he knew this from the getgo the term starvehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before the last scene says it allall the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney catherine zetajones matt damon brad pitt and don cheadle are just hanging out being themselves so the storys not important at allat least thats not where the films greatest pleasures come from if you want a clever heist movie better stick with 11 but if stargazing turns you on this will make your day,1
farscape  is the one scifi show which restarted the interest in science fiction in me  but farscape is so much more then plain and simple scifi comedy drama and much more  the acting is very good luckily farscape survived also its cancellation and showed with peacekeeper wars that it is not dead yet  i hope there is a future for farscape  in my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the show are muppets you have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty farscape is  farscape set a new standard in television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than farscape i love this show   saphirjd,1
i just love this movie and i have my tv programed to record it when it comes on again on nov 2nd it is a really nice love story with a twist the song that is played at the end of the movie is one you would not think would be a big hit but it is a song that stays in your head and i am now trying to find that song so i can hear it and play it i really have no style of the shows i see or the songs i like to hear and there for makes me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind i would like to say there is some parts in this movie that is not meant for the whole family to watch this movie does show skin it is kinda like a lifetime movie for women about women i say watch the movie and you may just like it as much as i did,1
could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie sad is about all i can say this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head what an awful waste of two hours noth should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage,0
personally i loved tris movie my best friend told me about it so i rented it out a watched it its amazing the music the acting the story lines the emotion everything well except for one minor fact absolutely no loyalty to the books at all i saw this movie before interview with the vampire and before i even knew the books existed so i was shocked to find how many people actually hated the movie i picked up quickly that the book fans werent at all happy with the unfaithfulness not wanting to be hypocritical i hate the harry potter movies due to lack of book loyaltyi stayed silent eventually i picked up the vampire lestat and understood immediately why everyone hated it it is completely different the movie queen of the damned is a combination of the vampire lestat and the queen of the damned but i still loved the movie from when i saw it before reading any of the books so if you havent seen this movie or read the book watch the movie first or youll hate it if you have read the book then you have every right to hate this movie,1
it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few however the movie depicts lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one i felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man there was too little content explaining how the man got to rise in the first place and the whole context of belgium letting them go so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent especially mobutu himself i would just have liked a better political analysis,1
ok so im not usually one that runs out and rents foreign moviesespecially foreign dark comedies i think i can count on one hand the number of films that i found genuinely hilarious from beginning to end this movie will be added to the short list even dark comedies right out of hollywood sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor but this one had my eyes welling up with tears my sides hurt i havent laughed that hard in a long time this movie was recommended by my mother and i dont think i would have even dreamed of watching it had she not raved about it dont be afraid of having to read during your movie  youll miss out on a hilariously wellacted flick,1
what can i say about this such a big prestigeproduction  but in the end wasted time wasted money  this work a disaster is historically seen only some examples   augustus often is named gaius  his first name pronomen but the old romans dont used this name correct would be the surname nomen gentile and cognomen or the octavian caesar augustus   livia was shown as tyrannic wife but this historically wrong   iulia was shown as nice young woman  but she wasnt one adultery and maybe prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her banishing   she wasnt at the dying bed of her father she never was allowed to leave her banishing and she was at this time around 50 years old not as young as she was shown in the same year augustus died she committed suicide because tiberius stopped giving her a pension   augustus was much more scruplesless then in this movie shown but author and director seems to believe augustus own res gestae  what remains historically extremely doubtful bad acting bad built and equipment  2 points out of 10  one for peter otoole,0
20 years ago dr chopperyes he is driving a chopper as well as chopping people up disappeared when the police found dead bodies at his clinic since then people have been disappearing around lake tanokaor something and dead bodiesparts of bodies has been found all over the place turns out dr chopper needs body parts to stay alive and has been taking them from strangers like pair of lesbians and 5 sorority girls on their initiationyou get the picture traveling through lake tanoka when a bunch of teenagers decide to go camping they are bound to clash with the doctor  well if you wanna waste some time this is the right choice acting varies from really bad to mediocre with the girls tripping and falling all the time for no apparent reason every chance of showing skin is taken but without actually showing anything at all the same goes for the special effects who are pretty pathetic with every slash filmed in an angle so you cant see it but there are a lot of body parts in the movie all drenched in bloodprobably to cover up how sad they really look  the plot is pretty faulty and dialog rather sad only time i laughed was when dr chopper said howdy when trying to be scary dont watch this one if your not a hacknslash freak even then i would recommend you to watch something better,0
a classic late 50s film the superannuated headliners joan crawford and louis jordan are not at their best but the direction cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling in a 50s sense which i love  the look and feel of the artsy overartsy contemporary film far from heaven reflects exactly this sort of film and i suspect this film may be one of the models a silly plot of course hey its 1959 but as a film glorious as a reflection of the society extremely interesting and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores fascinating,1
after a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy chainsaw massacrefeeling everything falls apart  spoiler alert as soon as the two fbiofficers start jabbing you know they are the real killers anyone who have seen enough of these fooledyamovies can figure this out  this movie is mader with one thing in mind to depict brutal murders why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well will this be next for us moviegoers the torture and abuse of children whats wrong with you people lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind,0
if this is film noir then noir must be french for glacially slow take a cast of completely unlikeable characters give them nothing to say punctuate the whole thing with gratuitous ultraviolence and youve got the formula for an aggravated dash could be subtitled sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from chinatown ripoff bruce derns one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick by the way i didnt like the film,0
as embarrassing as it is to admit i was listed as production manager on this film my very first as a matter of fact it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated watch carefully and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes as a soontobemurdered asylum attendant named cely my own last name  originally titled hostages this picture was changed to another son of sam by the producerdirector who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time nothing could have helped i dont even think this picture was good enough to be shown on mst 3k  the film was shot primarily with a collection of old mitchell cameras and early arriflex hand held cameras matter of fact the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own wwii era arri the picture was filmed entirely in charlotte and belmont north carolina in the mid seventies most of the stars were local tv newscasters and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or gullible enough to believe former stuntman and producerdirector dave a adams delusions of adequacy  if you enjoy watching this kind of picture you might love the work of another north carolinian the legendary earl owensby,0
yeah what did i expect i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turningpoint in life something like sonnenallee or american pie which i liked a lot i wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic wuerzburg and what did i get  attention spoilers ahead  this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy dialogues sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors i believe that this effect really was intended i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be  especially when they are stoned but really i dont need cinema to be bored by stoned friends talk boring dialogues make up most of this film  but okay thats one thing i can cope with that i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues just think of schwarzeneggers lifes work but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything just one example spoiler why do you think does someone take a garden hose to his hempplants deep in the forest to water them of course not usually you dont find waterpipes deep in forests do you the only reason this waterhose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of jaegermeister i truly hated this scene because its really violent usually i dont mind violence in films  slapstickcomedies are full of it but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people dont get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough slapstickscenes also seem real in this particular scene in lammbock i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured if not dead  the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle and the protagonists just walk away it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style the scene could have been quite funny  talking about being consistently  thats what i missed most about this film the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the authors mind things just happen without a apparent reason  yeah i know thats life but thats not cinema because cinema is meant to tell a story not to show boring episodes without any significance i found myself asking wheres the point all the time characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated you never get to know why the protagonists sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai in fact she tells you but i could not buy it not at all i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aidstest sketch which you sure have seen a thousand times before and mostly better the protagonists girlfriend you meet once then she leaves germany what you dont even see and the guy doesnt seem to care and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends he actually didnt you never really get to know whats so bad about studying law being daddys son daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film and living in beautiful wuerzburg even the dinner with daddys layerfriend which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dads expectations seemed flat just another nice dinner with the familys friends except for the trip the guy is on later but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isnt healthy was not the point of this scene if there was any i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams i couldnt understand one single character in the whole film they just seemed flat and implausible  all this made it a notsogood film but not one i wouldnt watch again on television it really had a few good scenes most of them were not new though like the one with the nice and understanding policemen some were really funny some dialogues were nice and i like bleibtreus play although he repeated his wellknown stereotypes again this time not good not abominable thats what i thought after the film was half over  but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive incest simply isnt funny i dont even know if this was intended to be funny some people in the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way this scene spoiled the whole film for me i couldnt feel sympathy for the protagonist any more  i cant feel sympathy for anyone who f a helpless person to me this is rape and rape isnt funny so it might have been a hint of drama or so but the incest is never again mentioned although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end but as it is never mentioned again we dont know it is even totally unnecessary i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story but not even this final cliche is fulfilled just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film it isnt really funny it isnt really a drama it isnt at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence it is definitely not enjoyable  skip this film watch final fantasy thats also bad but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless,0
he seems to be a control freak i have heard him comment on losing control of the show and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one ruleno snakes he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands   i watched the craig ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse he likes to bull sh to burn timei dont think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows  daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips he must do this at least 10 times a show i do like the joe firstman band carson daily needs to lighten up before it is too late,0
moscow zero stole my money and i want it back this is a horror movie not thriller not suspense a horror movie yes this movie is a horror horrifyingly bad after many years of lurking here at imdb i am actually moved to set up an account just so i like at least one other reviewer here can warn people do not watch this movie it will steal your soul or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button  seriously id love to hear the directors voice over on an enhanced dvd theres another horrifying thought to see what the hell they were thinking the producers had to assume there were enough suckers out there to fall for the val kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution  i actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand which provided no subtitles to the russian dialog not that it mattered much straining to hear the russian translate it in your head if you can only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury  i will give this movie a 1 because i cannot give it a lower rating and because it did achieve one remarkable thing it somehow made an almost entirely subterranean movie not feel claustrophobic now thats a dubious achievement  heres your spoiler and the ending holy mother no pun intended its like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming the climax of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape i have ever seen on film exercise your simple escape mechanism too if you find yourself watching this  the off button,0
some weeks ago at a movie theater i saw a movie poster of el padrino 2004 with the tag the latin godfather how lame have we become i thought latin just because he is a mexican let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to latium italy so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why we are called latinamerican people because we speak spanish a language based in the latin language that originated in rome now italy so to place a tag in a movie poster like the latin godfather is not just ignorant of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic now about the movie i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most,0
as is the case with many films of this ilk my non catholicism got in the way of my understanding it the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value then throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them and you have this book and movie i found myself thinking thats pretty cool why did they do that theres this casual thing in the robert langdon character where no matter what the issue he seems to always make the right first move i suppose its like watching csi where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days they know the lay of the land in this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on but if you create robert langdon you need to set him to work thats ok because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever i thought the film was fun i thought the da vinci code was fun too interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second,1

many animation buffs consider wladyslaw starewicz the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art puppet animation which he invented almost singlehandedly    and as it happened almost accidentally as a young man starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema but his unsuccessful attempt to film two stag beetles fighting led to an unexpected breakthrough in filmmaking when he realized he could simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them one frame at a time this discovery led to the production of starewicz amazingly elaborate classic short the cameramans revenge which he made in russia in 1912 at a time when motion picture animation of all sorts was in its infancy  the political tumult of the russian revolution caused starewicz to move to paris where one of his first productions coincidentally was a dark political satire variously known as frogland or the frogs who wanted a king a strain of black comedy can be found in almost all of starewicz films but here it is very dark indeed aimed more at grownups who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children who would most likely find the climax upsetting im middleaged and found it pretty upsetting myself and indeed prints of the film intended for englishspeaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with puns and quips in order to help soften the sharp sting of the finale  our tale is set in a swamp the frogland commonwealth where the citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters they decide to beseech jupiter for a king the crowds are impressively animated in this opening sequence it couldnt have been easy to make so many frog puppets look alive simultaneously while jupiter for his part is depicted as a droll whitebearded guy in the clouds who looks like hed rather be taking a nap when jupiter sends them a treelike god who regards them impassively the frogs decide that this is no improvement and demand a different king irritated jupiter sends them a stork  delighted with this formidablelooking new king who towers above them the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries the mayor steps forward to hand him the key to the commonwealth as newsreel cameras record the event to everyones horror the stork promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage swallowing citizens at random a title card dryly reads news of the kings appetite spreadeth throughout the kingdom when the nowterrified frogs once more beseech jupiter for help he loses his temper and showers their community with lightning bolts the moral of our story delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten is let well enough alone  considering the time period when this startling little film was made and considering the fact that it was made by a russian migr at the height of that beleaguered countrys civil war it would be easy to see this as a parable about those events starewicz may or may not have had russias turmoil in mind when he made frogland but whatever prompted his choice of material the film stands as a cautionary tale of universal application frogland could be the soviet union italy germany or japan in the 1930s or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny its a fascinating film even a charming one in its macabre way but its message is no joke,1
i would hope so and how can i get involved  this movie is a classic and ripe with laughs adventure and an all star 80s cast  what happens when you get together a group of jocks and sororiety a group of debating nerds a band of misfits and couple of couselors  a load of laughs that will have you begging for more  david naughton stars as adam the leader of the yellow team a kind and hip college counselor who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want to first dates  his nemesis is harold the leader of the blue team played hilariously by stephen furst of babylon 5 fame the no good loafing son of a wealthy former college jock with enough trophies to make any hall of famer jealous  pit these two against each other and throw in a red team a white team and a green team an unbelievable view at an observatory consequences of cheating at minature golf a super tour at the pabst blue ribbon beer factory and a hateful old landlady among other adventures and you have all the makings of a night to remember  look for appearances by michael j fox eddie deezen and director andy tennant in one of the last movies he acted in before becoming a director and you have an all star hilarious cast  the only down side to this movie was debra clingers performance as laura she terribly overacted but the rest of the movie is so good she can simply be ignored  i own this movie and can never watch it enough,1
this movie is a complete and utter waste of time one of the worst films ive ever seen and coming from me that is definitely saying something in fact i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic onestar awful  when i rented this movie i had an open mind i find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and i have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks but i draw the line at this one  the acting sucked the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines the lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance but that really doesnt take much  the chupacabra well considering how low budget this movie must have been the creature was tolerable it does however look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person but not so on screen  speaking of on screen youd think they could have at least used a better camera it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud not a very good one either  i dont know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking the dialog sucks and just i cant describe what i feel about it at least not without getting in trouble with the site  my advice avoid this at all costs its just not worth it if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch then find something else to do or watch read a book listen to music anything just dont subject yourself to this if you do you cannot say you werent warned and for lord and ladys sake dont rent this sucker it is not worth it even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents trust me i know,0
it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there  id feel a bit cheated if i had paid 15 for it but at about 150 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth   the film cant quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clichs from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is there  that guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie  favourite bit  for me the punchup on top of the oil refinery  if you look closely you can see the postapocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other  get several lagers in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel,1
someone says this anime could be offensive for girls not really embarrassing situations are funny first time i see this series i was in the video store people around me started laughing doesnt matter the age or gender a teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldnt be obvious by just reading the last page during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car during the last moments of the series the same car appears episodes had a touching and funny ending specially last one i dont regret to buy these series,1
i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many many years now so it didnt surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done i dont know whether i buy into kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman i took notice of her in the first mission impossible although her part was small she stuck out on the screen  here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off apparently ford a police detective in wash dc discovers that his wife was having an affair he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman  the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages the uncovering of deceipt and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one  i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable,1
for the main criticisms of the movie the love story that wasnt a love story those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy it added a feminine touch but come on look at american moviesno where close to love story there was no storyline does war have a storyline i think that is a silly criticism the storyline is this they start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died death is the ultimate end to any story just because there was no happy ending doesnt mean it has no storyline   there was a horrid truth in this movie i wouldnt necessarily call it antiwar it had a political statement of course but the movie wasnt all about the politics in fact except for a few occurrences when the captain showed up there was never a stifling air of nazi germany they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party the fat cats werent gonna go into russia  maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier id say exactly of almost any nationality and warand what they must go through it was a losing battle of course the movie is going to be depressing and to the person who said that it was gutsy and silly to even portray germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war any real soldier will tell you that  this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary a few problems with it when arguing for just one but it instills the best of both worlds watch it as such beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically emotionally  im waiting til they make a movie about iraq it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial i want to see who has the guts to do it first jarhead doesnt count,1
first the easy part this movie is pretentious crapola  it put me in mind of magnolia and then i thought wow somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than magnolia  i know nothing about the polish brothers but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling the trite plot elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough but the dialogue is just pathetic   detailed comments would just be a laundry list of failure the parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not the elegaic parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music the emotional parts are simplistic  the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters except for a little cornball dignity in the priest  i still cant believe the respect some people have given this picture,0
quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning pulp fiction however most of films especially of recent have been real real turkeys people still rate him and his stuff today and i really cant see why there are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies from this point on i shall not believe the hype that is a tarantino movie  inglorious was too long and worse still you felt it the humor was well minimal and not that humorous the violence was nothing new minus the end scene the dialog was sometimes very very drawn out  for some theyll love this movie and for others theyll hate it   and i thought the subject matter of nazis was finally put to bed with the awesome 2004 german movie der untergang,0
following the movie that represents the pinnacle of the 1980s ninja genre namely the revenge of the ninja salivating fans were treated to this bizarre offering that mixes ninja shenanigans with spiritual possessionthe end result being not dissimilar in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a nugget of human poop floating menacingly towards oneself in a public swimming pool  take for instance the supposed action packed introduction which is set of all places on a golf course here we witness an evil green clad ninja slaying a group of golfers for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever although i must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does irk me somewhat thoughhmmmm perhaps thats why he murdered themyep i can relate to that after all actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist but this story line is never elaborated upon nor alluded to ever again  anyway back to the intro the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassinand they have to keep on shooting him because he just wont stay down yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and still he gets up to slay evermore of the law enforcement numbers  finally after what seems like an eternity our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappearsor so it seems for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the soil and upon our decidedly gormless officers leaving the scene to search for his body he crawls out from hiding and staggers away  we next see the lovely lucinda dickey a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition here playing a telephone repair worker from her high vantage point she happens to spot the dying at last ninja however upon closer investigation the man supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and grapples her to the ground after a bit of a struggle our feisty heroine manages to break free luckily but doesnt count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them it is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine his intention is to use her corporeal form to slay those officers who killed him the few he didnt actually manage to wipe out initially  from this point on throughout the film whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some overwhelmingly awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed unto her levitating towards her in a most wobbly manner  to make matters more complex a particularly irritating police officer who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average yak to shame persists in trying to win her affections in a most bloody annoying mannerwell of course it doesnt take the gift of preconception to work out that in a rather feeble shock less twist towards the end of the film he is revealed to be one of the officers she must slay  but wait theres some hope yet   step forward the one and only sho kosugi  yes the ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that transpired there he flies all the way from japan to sort the situation out suspecting the worst in a brief sub story that amounts to all of a few seconds shos interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered shos fatherteacher and blinded one of shos eyes thus necessitating sho to wear a really decorative looking sword guard eye patch  after stealing his dead nemesiss body from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an unwitting abode for the evil soul matters climax at an oriental temple seemingly in the middle of nowhere where our man sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects  now reanimated from the dead the evil ninja and sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner beingwell yes you can probably guess  really this movie has only two things going for it namely the always excellent kosugi who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always and the lovely miss dickey what a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a rancid pile of ordure  oh well to be fair ive seen a lot worse than this in my time although i certainly still cant recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their sho kosugininja movie collections,0
i loved it it was really gruesome and disgusting i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome dont watch this if you have a weak heart you wouldnt be able to stand it,1
joline heather graham married carl luke wilson and about five hundred and some days later carl is very depressed and leaves her expecting to clean the fog in their lives joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for carl in texas she is very supported by her brother jay casey affleck who meets her in the border of mexico there joline meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision while jay knows carmen patricia velasquez and starts dating her and in the end life goes on this movie is very unpredictable having a very different story i believe it is an independent production in some parts it is a little slow and boring but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile i liked it and my vote is seven  title brazil rebeldes at o fim rebels until the end,1
oh dear gods this is awful stay away just stay away if you think youve seen bad movies think again never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie the acting if it is allowed to be called that is enough to cause internal bleedings inside your head the story is so thin it is just barely there no wait scratch that there is not a complete story there but once in a while there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness and believe me those few lines should have been shot the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from a distance  some may call me sarcastic in this review but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache however should you be what i like to call a visual masochist like myself please go right ahead and watch this monstrosity,0
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage i saw capturing the friedmans a short while ago and have to admit i thought this was better  the story is not an incredibly shocking one but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war block deftly guides the viewer through diaries family footage and afterthefact interviews his interview style is sensitive and probing and his insights are clear and measured  51 birch street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 4050 years of social change the social fallout and potential for redemption,1
this is bad movie there is no denying it as much as id like to tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality  somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be counteracted if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business unfortunately even truly deeply talented actors like goodman beatty sarsgaard gammon steenburgen macdonald pruitt taylor vince and lest we forget mr jones himself cant fix the wooden dialogue and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere  in fact at one point i looked up sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was 51 minutes into it  perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture if you havent seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie  the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie heavens prisoners starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie i may have to watch it now first to see if it is as bad as in the electric mist and second because i cant seem to no matter how hard i try break my man crush on alec baldwin,0
i liked this movie i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well the director gavin hood was supposed to be present for todays screening but alas his twins were born just hours before so he had to jet on a flight back 2 birthings in 24 hours was how he joked about it  rendition refers to extraordinary rendition  a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent without the legal consent of their parents nations to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained  its fairly predictable  innocent egyptianamerican man wrongly accused of being a terrorist goes missing while en route from south africa to washingon dc he is sent abroad while wife at home reese witherspoon fights to find him and free him but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in storytelling 1 a humantouch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bombdetonated 2 the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on and 3 the chronology of storytelling which makes it a tight taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments ah  relief and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending  allaround strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen,1
the premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile it is very poorly made but the idea was clever if not entirely original its a shame the other aspects of the film werent better the acting is especially bad,0
this is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all times i started to watch this right after interview with the vampire and i was thoroughly disappointed not only did this movies script have craters as big as the grand canyon the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving the viewers thoroughly puzzled the vampire lestat played by stuart townsend was terriblehaving a good body does not make you an actor the end of the queen was too easy and sudden insulting the viewers intelligence ill give this one star because aaliyah actually tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good other than that i would advice anne rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story,0
the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts but when i located them i could see that truth in this case was stranger than fiction judith light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role the mark i think of an excellent performance rick schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent no matter how criminal they may be one can find fault with the movie but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based,1
even if it wont give one more than previous posts here like ruby liangs very good one i wanted to share my own point of view hope my english is understandable  bon voyage is a rhythmic light but deep presentation of the french unorganized comedown but also courage and charm all along in a brilliantly reconstituted 1940 france with many details from bordeaux luxurious hotel occupied by government hq and attacked by useless high class french to parisian coffees near le pantheon  rue mouffetard and 1930s cars grard depardieu and yvan attal give their second roles a brilliant taste isabelle adjani and virgnie ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles and grgori derangre makes an bewitching performance  much lighter than average eg american war times movies and focused on the civilians bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues even to a french guy like me some of them quite deep,1
hood rat is absolutely terrible this is a urban version of willard i just cant believe this movie got made let alone distributed someone in universal studios thought that people would watch and like this movie the only good thing in this is icet as the landlord he was funny   the one thing i hate in movies is sped up action once or twice is bad enough but the whole movie is like that every scene transition is some fast motion special effect the director should be banned from making movies forever   trust me never see this movie,0
i agree that this film wasted my time and my money the poster mislead me to thinking it was a different type of movie i should have known given the unprofessional look of the poster someone should sue for false advertising,0
i feel terribly sorry where the lubitschpic was enchanting marvelous full of spirit and elegance this one here is only  colored lana looks like 51 in fact she was 31 at that time but obviously depressive and tries to play a shy and dull girlie think of jeanette mcdonald who gave the role of the widow a doublefaced depth by playing with count danilo that lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing  crazy she only sings one song  the title role of an leharoperetta that is really funny the only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end glamorous and  after watching this scene  have a look at the introducing waltz scene in gentlemen prefer blondes any similarities,0
hubie  like stanely the troll from bluths a troll in central park  lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie were supposed to like him because hes nice but thats about all he is  his character design is unappealing the top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head  and penguins should not have teeth i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor gilbert gottfried hubie with his weenie little voice provided by martin short looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak  tim curry who is usually delightful at being evil does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice not the supposedly menacing main villain  the entire plot revolves around the hero and villains love for female penguin marina who is just as dull as both of her suitors  worst of all is the pacing we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more  this time in dialogue this time in song  barry manilow may be a great songwriter but in animated films like this and thumbelina his songs feel limp and listless  especially the ballads the only song i liked was the 1930sish good ship misery song  i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmakers wishes and that could have caused some of the problems  though i suspect the real problem is that they didnt cut the rest of it,0
this movie needs to come out on dvd cause thats the only way i will buy it i thought it was soo funny because there was no real plot to it it was not suppose to be an oscar winning film i appreciate those films cary elwes was a very cute robin hood i cant even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good anyways peace out,1
running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny tos cannon in the solid good category as a crime thriller its not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it its a johnny to film after all it has to  andy lau has 72 hours to live he decides to play a strange catandmouse game with a hostage negotiator of the hk police played by lau ching wan thats the plot in a nutshell on top of that to piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it however just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and wellmade crime flick which lets face it are dimeadozen he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience providing the soul and heart to the welloiled skeleton  the concepts of synchronism and minimalism staples in his work are explored in great effect here always subtle letting the images speak for themselves giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots exemplary cutting to the score its all here a small love story in a bus between andy lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the heart im talking about so simple yet so powerful ditto for laus and lau ching wans car scenes and the bowlingroom showdown  however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece to has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times when hes good hes real good there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie im convinced that if he puts his heart to it he can make a really great film as it is this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable underneath the slick hk style its the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film worth watching definitely,1
what a pleasure this is really a parody only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse and as a result you spend a really good time watching jean dujardin playing the dumb most of the movie stands on his shoulders and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one he has the perfect way of overdoing the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike meyers in austin powers for example the dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the spectator with a lot of stupid jokes thats really perfect both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character and that was a challenge there is no really plot in this movie but thats not what is expected in this kind of movie you just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes and thats precisely what the movie manage to do it deserves the success it has in france,1
semper fi i saw the di in 1957 twoandahalf years later i joined the corps  web and company got it as right as they could in 57 boot in 59 was more like in fact exactly like the boot camp shown in full metal jacket  yes a black recruit in my training platoon was called snowball i was called stick because i was skinny as a rail every recruit had a nickname some rather vile that stuck with him through his service in the corps getting smacked or knocked on your ass when you screwedup was sop drop and give me fifty got to be hohum then it turned intodrop and give me twohundred  the dis were a bunch of sadistic bastards but it was a controlled sadism and with a primary purpose of keeping us stupid mofos alive when we hit combat 200 years of experience was ingrained in that sadism and everything the di did or said had a purpose geared to his mission  a bad di gets grunts killed a good di though seemingly the worlds biggest asshole keeps em alive you cant kill the enemy if youre dead  in case you didnt know the marine corps has one primary mission kill the enemy pfd  everything else is pure bravo sierra  mstgysgt wht usmc ret,1
okay heres the deal theres this american pilot whos flying along minding his own business when suddenly hes outnumbered by evil cowardly nonamerican fighter planes theyre middle eastern types but suffice to say they dont like apple pie or elvis presley who proceed to shoot him down now this american pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil nonamericans didnt care and before you know it hes banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death  now what would normally happen here is that the us military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time those evil peace lovin types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre as you can imagine this doesnt please the pilots family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him hell make those americans pay oh yes indeed  but he didnt reckon on doug masters the captured pilots 16yearold son you see doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which cant be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his dad back so with the help of his friends doug and his wingman retired pilot chappy sinclair doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners   now youd think that this plan would be bound to fail but youd be wrong sure those middle eastern types might be all veteran pilots but dougs got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies after shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down doug but the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky hurrah  after doug and chappy have shot down 90 of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot doug down but in the nick of time a flight of us f16s turn up and scare them away  i cannot recommend this film enough it was the first ever videocassette movie that i brought and until i was twenty i kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that i could rescue him but hes doesnt like flying so it didnt happen,1
1904 the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence as the various european powers  france germany britain russia spain and now the united states  are vying for influence in the region the sultan marc zuber is a weak puppet his uncle the bashaw vladek sheybal who is being manipulated by the french and germans is the real power behind the throne enter berber chieftan raisuli sean connery the leader of the rif tribe and the last of the barbary pirates who kidnaps an american missionary eden pedecaris candice bergen and her two children and takes them hostage back in the us president theodore roosevelt brian keith threatens to go to war over the issue pedecaris alive or raisuli dead  seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his big stick diplomacy though secretary of state john hay john huston is not so confident however the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event  john miliuss great historical film based very loosely off of a true story ie pedecaris was a middleaged man is a wonderful bit of escapism it has some amazing action scenes a witty wellwritten script a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not overstay its welcome like say pirates of the caribbean or the lord of the rings movies its not really an epic film in the strictest sense but its one of the best pure action movies ever made  while the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more pertinent today than it was when made as president roosevelt says america is like a grizzly bear  fierce strong but a little blind and reckless at times at the time of the films setting america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower following their resounding victory in the spanishamerican war  and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove americas worth in real life it didnt quite work out that way but allegorically it works well while written from a rightwing perspective miliuss screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world he admires roosevelt and his method of big stick diplomacy and correctly recognizes in the words of roosevelt that while america may be feared and respected theyll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do and there are some scenes  like roosevelts target shooting of european leaders and the almostcomic surprise attack by marines on the bashaws palace  which show americas reckless and violent side while others  the climactic showdown with the germans  show their heroism  the historicalpolitical context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing actionadventure film there are some brilliantly done action scenes such as raisulis rescue of the pedecariss from doublecrossing tribesmen which features some of the best swordplay in any film the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces and the final battle which combines elements of lawrence of arabia and the wild bunch while a major historical fantasy a threeway battle between germans americans and the rifs is a superbly staged adrenalinepumping sequence  the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film and it shows sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent but manages to pull off his interesting welldrawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern uncivil warfare candice bergen an actress whom ive never been fond of gives a fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris who is every bit as tough as her captor brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr  you really feel he must have been like this an athletic blustering yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self the scenes of roosevelt boxing and targetshooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history  and who can forget lines like why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality john huston provides solid support as the weary cautious hay acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt   among the fine supporting cast the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue and steve kanaly as the gungho marine captain who cheerfully advocates and carries out military intervention as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal nadim sawalha roy jenson larry cross marc zuber and darrell fetty also do fine work no matter how small their role spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saintjohn a fistful of dynamite as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisulis tribesmen  the wind and the lion is all around a wonderfully done adventure film it has something for everyone wonderful gun and swordplay a lot of humor a tough feisty heroine and her two cute children a nice if unconsummated romance and an interesting if fanciful politicalhistorical context its not a masterpiece but hey it wasnt trying to be i give the wind and the lion a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation,1
as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horrible  i could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point  i would have given this a 0 if possiblebad acting bad directing bad production bad plot  this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965 very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etc  i rarely ever see a scifi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a bmovie this is the very bottom of the lot  i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes junk like this gives good lowbudget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look good  the thing about watching directtovideo movies is just when you think youve seen the worst you see something even worse  dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out  avoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity,0
i read the book after seeing the movie and didnt care for it finding it somewhat trashy but trashy books often make good movies and this one certainly could have the story of a teen girls exploration of her attractive power over boys which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolfrythis story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made an appeal of one kind to girls and of another kind to boys and i dont understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody  to begin with take the title which is the best thing about the book its drawn from a hesse quotation also used as an epigraph about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth one tasting as bad as the other this is a wonderful metaphor for the heroines state torn between her human and wolf sides savoring each but equally fearful of both the movie dispenses with the epigraph and instead introduces the character working in her aunts chocolate shop i can understand how the books title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of like water for chocolate and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves but they didnt so why is it in the movie in the book the characters are in high schoolor in and out as with the five a teen gang who favor black jeans and tshirts and fall somewhere between being the heroines nemeses and her pet peeves in the movie theyve become decadent twentysomething clubgoers in the book the heroine is 16 just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants as well as on herself shes the one who initiates the contact then steps back reinitiates and so on in the movie shes no longer a girl but a woman and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law and a comic book artist to boot its he who comes on to her in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin she initially puts him off but then gives in as hes confident she will hey you know you want it i would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncompliant proactive role but no  in the book the heroines clan is driven from their home because of the fives delinquent behavior in the movie its because she went for a run shes a great runner prone to kicking off from building walls and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in a trice very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves or anything resembling them in the book they dont turn into actual wolves but things bigger than wolves in the movie theyre just ordinary wolves in the book they metamorphose in howling style with crunching of spines this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her as well as the pleasure in the movie the werewolves have become magical acrobats taking great swan dives and transforming in midair shimmering yellow like tinkerbell it looks cool means nothing  in the book the clan is a slightly whitetrashy family that has relocated from west virginia to maryland in the movie they live in bucharest but all talk in different accents none romanian in the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure thatand indeed their survivalone necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans and so the characters keep saying in the movie yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground bossbut apparently not a crime boss since he despises criminalsand has a standing deal with the police who supply him with meat for the pack this seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder  at the end of the book the heroine learns she cant be something shes not when in her effort to live a divided life she gets stuck between the human and animal states unable to be all one thing or the other her boyfriend isnt sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is the pack cant risk having him around and the two are forced to separate in the movie she rescues him like lassie and they drive off to paris why paris in an ending thats smileyfaced but not really happy since the conflicts between their naturesbetween her naturesremain unresolved  but the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally within the realm of young adult novels those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible every other line is a threat or some other kind of oneupsmanship youll be sorry you dont belong here you wont get rid of me i gave you your chance etc i prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way  there have been many good vampire movies never a good werewolf movie had this one stuck to the book it might have been the first  but no,0
i loved this movie when i was a kid i saw it theatrically randy edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack david seville is the chipmunks father and recording manager the chipmunks consist of alvin who is best known for playing the harmonica simon who is a bright and studious chipmunk  theodore who is the youngest and is always hungry there is a lady known as miss miller who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as brittany jeanette  eleanor who all have the same character as the chipmunks my favourite songs from this soundtrack include diamond dolls the girls of rock  roll  the touching my mother alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business the chipmunks meet the chipettes playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing,1
this film is a great disappointment director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril in juana la loca he relies on a gifted actress as well  newcomer pilar lopez de ayala but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband it seems as if she werent able to develop her character over this onedimensional feature juana was an important figure in spanish history and politics of that time were essential in her storyline but here shes introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera this is a real pity and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa worst of all italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances which in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso a pivotal role in this story it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences as both of them look like topmodels of this era on the other hand talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped even if this was a bigbudgeted film little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating period pieces on the screen costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes as if they were taken from stock materialwithout regarding of a real coherence all in all the main problem with juana la loca and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth is the lack of a directors point of view this a strange turn in arandas career as he was able to develop it in other works libertarias and amantes come to my mind creating very personal and interesting movies while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece and a not very good one at that,0
i recently saw house of wax and must say i really enjoyed it  its been one of the better horrorthriller films in the past few years if not one of the best and most entertaining  ive heard a lot of people bashing the socalled slow start and character development which takes up the films opening 45 minutes  yet if the film dived straight into the deaths audiences and critics would have criticised the film for not having decent characters who they couldnt care less about  well as for the character development i think it worked amazingly well  taking into my own response and others from reading posts off the message board a lot of people ended up wanting the characters to live one of which ive noticed many people mentioning being paige edwards paris hilton taking into consideration warner bros have been marketing her death its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival  speaking of the chasedeath scenes they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful ive witnessed in a while and enjoyed each one very much  the acting in the film was absolutely fine i couldnt fault any of them especially paris hilton i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film yet her chase scene made up for that and believe me when i say paris can act scared watch the scene where shes hiding in a car from vincent and he walks past her  the look of terror on her face comes across as very real  overall i give house of wax maximum stars for entertainment value and suspense and even gore  only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film they hadnt revealed the death list and who dies and who survives as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death  cant wait for the dvd but go see it at the cinema while you can it wont be the same in your own front room yet if you do wait for the dvd watch the film in the dark with no interruptions trust me you wont be disappointed,1
this is a great valentines day gift a gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition at a baking contest very romantic im a real fan of costas mandylor since his days at picket fences and he hasnt lost his appeal lauren holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together the supporting cast was good as well seeing all those wonderful desserts being made was a delicious sight in itself i loved that costas and lauren teamed up to win in the baking competition and in love this is the kind of film that satifies all palates romantic and otherwise hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception the whole family can view this film also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity i found myself sighing and wishing for more for this film and also yearning for those wonderful desserts i recommend this film highly for all ages a great treat for all,1
may or may not contain spoilers   inuyasha is not a good anime its actually very overrated why theres absolutely no story line no plot and the show just drags on and on and on thats because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again the same episodes seem to go with the same plot kagome sensing a jewel shard a wormslimetentacle demon thing pops up inuyasha says windscar iron reaver soul stealer etc and kills the demon they get the jewel shard and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times  besides the repeating of episodes theres the repeating of comedic devices and theyre not funny anymore wait they never were sexual harassment is not funny viz rated the series older teens 16 i have no idea why they rated it that theres nothing bad about it except for the socalled funny sexual harassment which is kind of suggestive and that could get you arrested these days  now this is how we know inuyasha is overrated the videogames they all sucked especially the mask game i played that at my friends house it wasnt anything interesting the game was slow boring and it had nintendo 64 like graphics in a magazine it got a rating of 410 saying this roleplaying game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw then theres all these stupid inuyasha toys action figures trading cards stickers and coloring books coloring books we thought inuyasha was 16 maybe not but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn about half the people on there were 10 to 13 i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show it could be shown on toonami there are over 40 manga volumes i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them sad  then theres the music the music is so annoying we hear the same 5 songs every episode after 10 episodes the music gets really annoying in other anime they have music to fit the mood and we dont hear some songs very often there are about 15 different inuyasha soundtracks dont waste your money on that garbage  and how do you think i know all this because i used to be a fan of inuyasha i feel ashamed of myself id rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead sadly those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have,0
i saw this years ago and its entertaining but not profound the basic story is of a young man who dreams of midian though hes not sure where it is or even if it really exists  spoilers follow he finally visits it gets transformed to a nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one then he has to help the other members of the nightbreed because theyre being attacked by canadians save for the accents they all act like good ol boys not much in tune with the canadian psyche eh someone observed for monsters or nightbreed substitute jews and for the canadianshumans substitute nazis and youre supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans well maybe  one major objection i had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather ramshackle and frankly dirty this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements one would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of decor  the storyline is a tad thin but thats to introduce characters but its entertaining enough for a repeat view,1
a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face  should be compulsory viewing for all politicians  take your pick from privacy nuclear sustainability global climate change quality of life  reminiscent of thoreaus walden but with modern twist and considerable humour   im not finnish although ive travelled there and have good finnish friends but i found it totally accessible and also culturally informative,1
this has to be my favourite film the script is sharp and played to the limit by an excellent miller and fantastic carlisle sharp wit excellent narrative and no hollywood polishing a totally immersible film which has you gunning for the bad guys stott excels again as the detestable chance while liv tyler truly beats her other lighter performances as the excitementhungry rebecca the soundtrack may not be known to you by name but anyone who has ever seen top gear watched the football or seen any tv action sequence is probably familiar with it particularly due to craig armstrongs escape which must allow him never to work again the soundtrack on first play may seem out of place in a costume dramaactioncomedy but one rewatching shows it is perfectly at home in giving the the script its drama  my one gripe about this film is that it isnt shown enough on tv where is it truly excellent sharp and classy  youll not regret watching it  again and again exits to switch on dvd player,1
saw this film the first time in 1953 with my older brother it was one of the great 3 demension films released in that era we saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it scott does a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the indian arrows rather than surround sound oh for those polaroid lenses again,1
wow why arent more british movies like this great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great one to hunt down and watch look out for it ten out of ten,1
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen  its so full of details and every time you see it youll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they cant do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there arent   i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever  i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skitso the machinist secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them,1
just to clarify matthew poncelet wasnt a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers  i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real the character is based on a mixture of two killers elmo patrick sonnier and robert lee willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well  prejeans approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the victims families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel remorse for what they dideffectively aiding both parties  everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence its not my place to say its right or wrongin theory punishing death with death makes some sort of karmic sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although costly makes more sense to mebeing stuck in a small room 237 with one hour of exercisefor the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishmentthey are technically alive but denied living say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like susan smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake i find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned  prejeans point comes through the story very well she has my respectshe manages to find that balanceshe isnt supporting a killer she is guiding them to accepting what they did if they didnt feel some kind of remorse they wouldnt be asking for spiritual guidance  ona final note when poncelet apologizes to delacroix parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didnt apologize for her death i think the point was that throughout the movie poncelet denies killing both kids there is doubt in prejeans mind he did both killingsthere is a friend who was sentenced but not to deathmy thought is that poncelet killed the delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girlhence poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did had he been responsible for the girls death he probably would have apologized for that as well,1
this may not be regarded as a review on any film but just a comment on a film i saw when i was a youngster i remember coming home of an evening all full of wonder at what i had seen i tried to retell my parents part of the story but they listened without understanding well what was so strange about two kids stranded on an island who fall in love and grow together and have a son as you must have guessed by now im referring to the blue lagoon 1949 which has kept me bewitched and bewildered through the years almost 50 and now wonder full of anxiety and disgust who or what has prevented the film from being available in cassette or dvd or whatever ive spent a lifetime chasing the opportunity to get hold of it one day and nobody knows anything about it what a waste indeed sorry if my english is not at all technical or scientific but my mother tongue is spanish im doing my best to make myself understood thank you my name is juan and im writing from uruguay in samerica,1
i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line zahn spends so much time mimicking duvall he does nothing else in the show and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man unlikeable yes but weak never we never see how or why they go to back to lonesome dovewhich is a dirt hole in the originalwhy would they ever leave austin where they are herosfor doing nothing during the whole moviei was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast there is no warning about how many segments there areit just ends this miniseries could have been somebodytragic it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the jag,0
the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what youd expect  the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris  cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael tollin  mike rich were trying to do firstclass movie  esbjrn nordby birch denmark,1
this is a fine underrated film and rip torn wellknown as he is is a seriously underrated actor i read howard frank moshers novel many years ago how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermonts northeast kingdom i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the irasburg incident took place ive not seen stranger in the kingdom the cravenmosher collaboration based on the incidentand another mosher novel but this film has inspired me to track it down,1
it doesnt matter whether drew or leelee are total babes but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy this movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for real people it made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are this movie represents the real world and that what really matters,1
the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldnt have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade given the lack of funds this short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audiences and protagonists expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial setup does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept the muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at times  one can easily see nolans style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans,1
while there is a lot to recommend about maetel legend both in concept and finished product its ultimately a poor film plot wise its a retelling of maetels early life which is usually unclear at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire and since leiji matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for emeraldas her sister her mother the queen of la metalle and a bit of galaxy express 999 to flesh out the film  in short maetel is a princess on the planet la metalle a planet with an irregular orbit thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and its artificial sun is dying the planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story thus increasing the sense of doom in order to protect her subjects and family the queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of la metalles people enter lord hardgear a robot  cyborg who provides the means for the job through the film the characters are left to question mechanisation will they still be human can hardgear be trusted do souls and hearts remain so for a fan of matsumotos work theres lots to enjoy questions to be answered themes continued except its obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction as well as a fan curiosity the negatives foremost the animation while galaxy express 999 a tv series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design maetel legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to galaxy express 999 the design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that slide as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms a quick way of animating however the few yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences repetition and in extra scenes anyone whos seem the film will wonder how many times lord hardgear can drink the same glass of wine  next the story while in concept everything sounds great the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations add to all of that some terrible character design that seem lifeless over exaggerated and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film at least the newcomers wouldnt be left baffled  and yet it really has its moments the ending at least is surprising the plight of the citizens of la metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing i guess i find that whole manmachine theme distressing its hard know who to recommend maetel legend to since its not well animated written or executed plus confusing once leiji matsumotos mandatory crossreferencing is introduced however i cant help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of threenine occurs now thats good cinema  15 stars out of 5 2 if youre a fan,0
as a zombie fan i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters pb is also an excellent tiein to chronicles of riddick cor the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness there are so many metaphors in the story riddick is this bad guy but hes also the hero who tries to save the slowpaced folks the muslim guy imam relies on the suns positions for the five times a day prayers but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule overall i recommend this film to any scifi fans you wont be disappointed,1
i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes i just couldnt stop laughing at dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the stoopidest thingsbut at the same time hes just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very tranquiluntil along comes robbie coltrane not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you havent got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though  i was lucky as my local video store stocks it,1
cameron mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to date the head of a movie studio shes too young for both of them at a party when hes lighting his cigarette the studio boss throws a high alcohol content drink in his face and he catches fire in the hospital his face is entirely bandaged and he still lights up a cigarette he becomes the resident sculptor of the movieland wax museum and palace where he also lights up cigarettes  mitchell recovers more or less having really poorly done burn makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray spackle and tape and an eyepatch when mitchell isnt smoking hes killing people well he only kills people sometimes since he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a sort of waxy coma if he doesnt administer it regularly and he never seems to remember they start to move again a little although theyre in a sort of hypnotic zombie state not all his sculptures are people though he evidently does have talent as a sculptor  the ending which seemed to have been struck from a much poorer print than the rest of the movie is really absurd they seemed not to know what to do and went back to the title for an idea apart from the oddly grainy final shots the rest of the movie is in fairly good shape except for the audio in some scenes which sounds like it was run through a blown speaker definitely not one of the better wax museum movies,0
this is one of the best episodes of doctor who ever we have the cybermen the cyber conversion units may scare young children and of coarse the doctor doing one of his best acts bravo david tennant good scenes as if it was a movie with thrilling scenes in some streets an invasion on the cybermans base and leaving the world different to ours basically a 45 minute movie  being part 2 of rise of the cybermen this would never disappoint with it having a great build up to the final  the doctor plus an evil enemy daleks cybermen master sontarans davros autons or even macra is a battle to the death just be careful with young children watching this,1
okay now i know where all those boring cophomicide tv shows came from i do believe they can be traced back to this movie scene of the crime feels more like a tv episode or an episode of a serial complete with stock characters and situations  the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors the aging cop who doesnt want a desk job despite failing eyesight the reckless rookie the doublecrossing dame etc  i like many of the actors here and they do a good job but overall i found this movie dull as im not a fan of the genre i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case something about bookies and informers and oh yeah there was a stripper played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven what i want to know is why did she keep calling van johnson uncle wiggly wasnt uncle wiggly a rabbit a character from a childrens book what the heck does that have to do with anything i guess i just dont get toughguy film noirish kinda jargon  in fact much of the dialogue made me mutter nobody talks like that however i could relate to one scene where the cops wife arlene dahl who worries every time he goes to work realizes that maybe she shouldnt have made her husband the center of her life yeah i know that feeling of loving someone so much being so dependent on them that theres a constant fear for their safety so there are moments of truth in this film underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so selfconsciously to be gritty and real that it actually seems unreal to me  a little background this movie was made when dore schary took over mgm from louis b mayer and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great dore schary was determined to bring more realism to movies i kinda hate dore schary maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious bleak movies being made today wallowing in the ugly truths about life focusing on and in my opinion helping to perpetuate the worst of humanity rather than the best no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do  providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii  well damn it we still need that kind of distraction today theres still plenty of depression and plenty of war and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape trashy braindeadening reality tv thanks a lot dore,0
when i first heard about greek i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous another of abc familys sobadtheyrealmostgood shows but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected  as a member of a greek society i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen the opening scene harkened to an onlyslightlydramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there  this isnt a show for oversensitive greeks if you get offended even at jokes about things that arentsogreat about greek life then youll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it its nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is,1
turkish culture is complete with lots of different cultures different cultures have different styles of music istanbul is like the mixture of turkey it has mostly the same language but different dialects this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments you can watch reportings with singers and groups their performances  their daily life and learn their thoughts of music the movie includes not only the music of istanbul but the life in istanbul  how people communicate and what they eat and drink the surprising part is although i live in istanbul i learned lots of things from this movie,1
this was the second cinemascope spectacle that fox produced after the robe notice how some of the roman sets are redressed to pass for egyptian sets the film is produced with all first class elements beautiful photography stirring soundtrack alfred newman and bernard herrmann  see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes however the principal acting is a bit weak edmund purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch the best performances come from peter ustinov as the oneeyed slave and polish actress bella darvi as the babylonian temptress nefer i find this movie in general to be strong on plot which is rare for these large spectacles produced at the time all in all the film does an interesting and entertaining job of social commentary on what egyptian society might have looked like,1
its just when a band tours and only has one original member its not the same as the classic line up all new actors playing the main roles of rag scotty etc with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie and he was of only minor note of the first flick serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females the film is poorly written featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon even for a ta movie this one is a turkey not even die hard low budget 80s films fans would want to sit through this movie which has no plot and plenty of bad acting this film would have been better off never being released just plain bad,0
manna from heaven is a delightfully compelling film  within the shifting paradox of values in middleclass americans from 40 years ago to the present day the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of damon runyonesque characters  their struggles with moral dilemmas dotting on what might have been hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams romantic yearnings and hit it big combine to make a most entertaining film rather than relying upon inyour face sexual explicitness the burgeoning relationship between inez and macbake is classically subtle but clear his untying the knot in her shoelace at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding  the scripts crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast one of the few films i have ever fone to see twice in its opening run manna from heaven definitely warrants national distribution  conrad f toepfer,1
this film grabbed me right from its start where a sweetlooking teenaged girl is shown visiting a grave alone then elton johns powerful song friends starts playing while shes shown walking alone through the streets of paris carrying a suitcase naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her the entire film is a beautiful dreamy romantic collection of scenes of young love holding hands living in the country wild horses running around freely fields of wildflowers sunsets toasts of wine evenings by the fireside having fun and general innocence all set to romantic music by elton john its magical  somehow i missed seeing this film when i was growing up im sure it would have left a strong impression on me if i had seen it then i remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 talking about how it was a special movie with music by elton john and with the chorus of the theme song friends playing in the ad makin friends for the world to see but i never heard anything else about it in those days and never got to see it until i rented it 35 years later from a video store by then it had been edited censored and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film what can i say the world has gone insane since then  the story is that a 14yearold girl is forced to move in with her cousin in paris after both her parents die it was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene one day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15yearold boy they hit it off and agree to meet the next day the next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident it was his fathers car he cant bear to go back home to face his fathers wrath so the two teenagers begin living in the french countryside together with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home they settle into an unoccupied cottage the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves their supposed friendship turns into romance the girl becomes pregnant and they successfully have a baby at home all the while the boys father has the police attempting to locate his missing son on the 1year anniversary of the couples flight together the police finally locate the boys employer by an inperson inquiry and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work the next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriendwife and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye at least thats how the video version i saw ends its an unexpected though welltimed ending presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered  as beautiful as the story and images are the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived i think its better just to enjoy the movie as a young persons dreamcometrue fantasy and to go no further in analysis because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year what did they plan to do when the owners returned why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him didnt they think it was unethical to use other peoples homes and food how could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society how could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free how is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo the elton john song lyrics just dont fit why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when its about to get cold and so on the scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls as is the unrealistic theme of friendship before romance and all the backwashing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes the running through flower fields towards each other the haze filters the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground the baby ducks and so on it works but its definitely contrived  still this is a movie about youth and freedom and that ideal hasnt changed since the 1970s young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom therefore the message is universal its clear why a sequel wouldnt work this story is about a magical yearlong reprieve from the real world such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely assuming that it could even happen in the first place and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence i really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt but i hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the 70s learned something from it and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others instead of perpetuating societys various hatreds and repressions especially on their own children,1
i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9  dunderklumpen is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way it reminded me of hrpuffinstuff on sat mornings its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes  dont expect older kids to be interested as the live actionanimation is way behind the times and most older kids will get boredthis is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974,0

wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes a grand day out the wrong trousers and also a close shave some of the best animated footage ever put on television winning several oscars and also countless other awards nick park became quite the popular man in the uk yet his impact on the united states has not been big after the third wallace and gromit short there was all this speculation about a fulllength wallace and gromit movie yet for years nothing had happened then in 2000 instead of a fulllength wallace and gromit film we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park which was chicken run which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project  5 years later these kinds of films do take long you know and a lot of anticipation wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign this movie delivers in so many ways this film will be a delight for both kids and parents with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation wallace and gromit curse of the wererabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations  wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeoples crops from being ruined by rabbits which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople to add to that wallace wants to impress lady tottington which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor simple plot yes but there is more than meets the eye be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons  in animated films with little dialogue it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage the payoff is fantastic there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible or it is the ohsoadorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film most curse of the wererabbits humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late just picture the movie madagascar except funnier much fewer pop culture references and better animation  casting was great even though in a film with not much dialogue it was not that important peter sallis yet again does a wonderful job as wallace even though in this movie there was no standout quote that can be used anytime the wrong trousers its the wrong trousers gromit and theyve gone wrong ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit fight club lends her lovely voice as she plays wallaces love interest even though nothing could top the final chase in the wrong trousers curse of the warerabbit did have plenty of action scenes including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victors evil dog last but not least the rabbits really steal the show at some moments whether it is their cute expressions their funny movements or their howling the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars the funniest rabbit in the movie is the cursed rabbit himself to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter  bottom line despite not being as memorable as the wrong trousers this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run unlike almost every movie to come out this year the movie does not drag at all clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun it will leave everyone watching it asking for more there is very little wrong with the film it was a pure delight to watch this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar uncut raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year 40yearold virgin wedding crashers and sin city and for families and those who want harmless entertainment that is a good thing highly recommend this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade wallace and gromit curse of the wererabbit totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5100,1
i would say bride of chucky is a return to greatness but the series was never really great very good 1 was 23 were throwaways and i think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie and it contains the best subtitletagline chucky gets lucky so he does in the role of jennifer tilly who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for star trek voyager tilly didnt just create a presence she added much needed humor backstory drama tension and a great little sidekickplaything for chucky and as much as i liked her in the feature she cant get all the credit the props watch the first 12 minutes for horrorhomages the writing the inside jokes again the opening  pinhead and chucky lines were great in fact if this were a movie it would take 34 sequels just to do it justice among others mercifully chucky and the series has given up on andy the hide the soul quest and just settled for a new way out of his body he teams up with his ex tilly whom he transfers into a bride doll and a couple of bonnie  clyde teens really heigl to regain this pendant buried with chuckys human corpse this is for any chucky fan 1980s slasherhorror fans or even to those whos never seen any of the previous childs play films its funny dark harmless gory  but not over the top and despite tillys literal 20 minutes of screen time its always great to see her after all you barely see her play poker anymore side note of course i picked up on the superman reference  hackensack nj,1
i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time as soon as i got home i raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed while it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book the similarities end there the characters are changed ie finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly scenes are misplaced or altogether changed ie lepper many characters are missing and famous linesthought are missing the movie does attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat boring movie it is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this movie takes those things and utterly destroys them in its rewriting,0
i had heard of john garfield but didnt know him i loved this movie i had never heard of it i just picked it up randomly john garfield is a boxer in the movie he had been in real life also so he knew his part he was a fugitive throughout the movie someone else killed a man he character was blamed he is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him all sorts of minor plots ensue my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldnt swim and none of them could get outjohns character saves the day the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers one of them right to the very end ann sheridan played the familys daughter and johns eventual love interest she was believable but not lovable in my opinionthe only weak link in the movie,1
karim hussains masterpiece of artgorethis cat is definitely a talent to look out for we have in this several longer vignettes interspliced with some shorter segues this is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewers  the film kicks off with a short called ovarian eyeball very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked an unseen womans hand covers the supine womans face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen out of which an eyeball stalk is extracted ive got nothing too much to comment on this one due to its brevity  human larvae is one of the films lynchpins and it is a totally unflinching portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister this is one of those must be seen to be believed type things i will say that this film has some of the best effects ive seen in an indie horror film but the subject matter will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most not me thoughi live for this  rebirth could have been cut out of this film all together this is the films weakest segment and it has a bunch of nude people fcking bloody holes in a field and whatnot very short but this one kind of blows the films momentum  right brainmartyrdom is one of the most profane representations of religious imagery that i have ever seen and it totally kicks ass think p iss christ or menstrual blood paintings of the virgin mary very hard sexualsexually violentgory imagery is presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who will be offended by sacrilege  subconscious cruelty is one of the best films ive seen under the banner of extreme horror it will be a very divisive film amongst horror fans and the filmgoing public in general some will call it trash some will call it brilliant i dont see much middle ground i thought this film was pretty damn original and i will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it 910,1
wow whats this on the video rental stores shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to 8mm it wasnt a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie  basically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david huxley and his fiance tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute risa the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city the mystery is solved when in the end tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiance which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end  i didnt like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene otherwise its a totally different movie it made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didnt believe the words coming out of davids mouth the whole time but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble  there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative  david was no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he was the main problem long before the end the actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress tishs father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs too because it wasnt even about a last breath nobody really dies but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowherebut that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 34 long movie  go rent and maybe buy the original its one of joel schumachers better and more original films it has everything better about it from this film i wouldnt recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges,0
i loathe despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison its nothing but a campy frightening and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that ohsonasty time the 70s a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer  the animation is sickeningly dated not least of all with its tacky missing frames and characters with huge bulbous heads this film is an eyesore from the knowing snide nod to the parents with the freakily gay sea horse and its camp hand motions and kenneth williamsesque voice to the overtly unsubtly druggy anthem high cockalorum this film im sad to say is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me  this ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an r rated certificate so disturbing it is in its contents,0
the end of suburbia teos is a very useful film its also important and provocative there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment the antisprawl meister james howard kunstler   while i am not a big fan of the new urbanism my criticism of it is because of its small vision in the case of new urbanist peter calthorpe  another talking head  you finally hear whats somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added teos outtakes calthorpe just doesnt understand peak oil   ive used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production  a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics  and also as a vehicle for educating about peak oil our wastrel land use global warming our threatened food production public transit our compromised future  move over south park  made by canadians from toronto for 25000 and released in may 2004 this video sold over 24000 copies by october 2005 one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies  the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 12 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005  a sequel escape from suburbia is in the works with a possible release by august 2006,1
i thought this movie was going to be good it absolutely wasnt despite the oscarwinning lead actors i may have laughed once and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing renee zellwegers pancake makeup was very unbecoming everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off i think perhaps the movie mustve sounded good in development but something got lost in translation were the roaring 20s really like this i think not everything seems a tad artificial randy newmans score was annoying the film is in sepia tones just like every other movie that takes place in the 20s or 30s theres just not that much originality here,0
i have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things this is not a funny movie i must say that the plot line is awful i did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it but it was enough for me the characters are not very inspired just terribly annoying this movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with his tyrannous bosss daughter when he finally manages to talk to her she asks him to go at that night at her home to watch her fathers owl and he thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at 6 pm he gets to be very disappointed finding out that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend after her father leaves home leaving precise orders about taking care of the house and his beloved bird appears a secretary a renegaded son and all sort of not funny stuff happens in the house but he finally hooks up with his bosss daughter trust me this movie is terrible,0
i caught this filmshow about the most unlikely success from a lower league football team the plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns intercut with shots and commentary from the 70s i was taken aback by its shear footy fun  a great cast includes the excellent tim healy as the crazeddrunk manager  bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win i keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that don revie super leeds united and england managerloved by the fans hated by everyone elsehas on bostock united  the underfelt men which in its detailed report of their opposition bostock united in this the fa cup final merely says shte  lots of other footy gags a long time before the fantastic feature length mike basset  football manager starring ricky tomlinson  up there with the gung ho english beating germans at football well morallyalthough the score lines says different  of escape to victory  i still cheer when england score   and the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in micheal palins golden gordon from ripping yarns series  with terry jonesthe team were called bostonworth united in case your interested  ive looked high and low for a copy of bostocks cupeven nick hancocks biography doesnt list it  probably someone not mr hancocks error  play it again or sell me a copy please,1
who can ask for more taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk i admit but well worth it they were enthralled from credit to credit with their parents beside them  i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results too scary too boring too sophisticated whatever with this film however i was glad to see a smart film with wit style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen any film that takes 5 years of production to make good or bad deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this  ok im gushing a little then again why wouldnt i get excited looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed at least for the moment regardless w  g is a film well made perhaps the originality wasnt the most inspired nevertheless well told and well paced  too much adult humour too many sex references maybe though my kids didnt quite catch them too young so in my case i didnt really notice  well needless to say i liked it,1
after i saw this i concluded that it was most likely a chick flick afterward i found out that keiras mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it however a chick flick can have some appeal to men this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women looking at the dismal box office receipts one item that i believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene in the movie whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated wo anesthesia though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not women understand this even better i suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste in fact a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really excels in that department this could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of dylan thomas during wwii and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then keiras screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against dylan but really muddles this instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together sort of in a way perhaps somehow of note is the fact that a soldier the husband of the friend of dylans wife is sent back home after serving in combat yet it is unclear if the war has ended a lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear and though i have stated that already i will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess,0
as far as fake documentaries go fakumentaries anyone this one is up there with the best it looks very real and that is what it aims for in recent light of events guantanamo this movie is even scarier so you could say it was ahead of its time when it was released in the 70s   one can only hope that a government like that doesnt exist looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same 70s mentality screw the politicians and politics in general maybe that wasnt so clever one might think  but hey dont forget its only a movie o,1
i have a question for the writers and producers of prozac nation what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in america in the moving performance of christina ricci as liz wurtzel the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a harvard student and as a writer but this is not a story of success only one of selfdestruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her the film examines divorce family dysfunction drugs alcohol and prescription medication as possible reasons for lizs unhappiness but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory  at some point in the film it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in the united states of depression in the story liz had a caring therapist anne heche a caring roommate michele williams a caring boyfriend jason biggs and a troubled but caring parent jessica lange in a key scene in the film liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the breakup of the space shuttle challenger instead of equating challenger with lizs life the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery  this film reminded me of a generic madeforcable victim film on the lifetime network an excellent cast was wasted especially in the earnest performance of christina ricci the reallife elizabeth wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit,0
in new york a group of freshmen join the high school for the performing arts after being well succeeded in their audition for four years their dreams deceptions success love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure doris finsecker maureen teefy the homosexual montgomery payl mccrane the aggressive leroy gene anthony ray the hopeful coco irene cara the ambitious ralph garci barry miller and their friends until their graduation day  twentyeight years ago fame was a great success with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business and i loved this movie and the soundtrack on cd i have just watched fame on dvd and presently i would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only but with too many flawed subplots the story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer i do not know whether alan parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie but what happened for example with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion what happened with leroy and his teacher did he fail due to his grammar problem what happened with coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook the musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot anyway fame is still a delightful entertainment and a cultmovie for me my vote is seven  title brazil fama fame,1

babettes feast for me is about healing mending the schism between spirit and body in orthodox christianity this puritanical community in remote denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of gods gifts in creation they have taken the dualism of st paul to an extreme and stress the life of the spirit not the life of the flesh both elderly sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village they and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the sisters father the aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome and the sisters dont know what to do enter babette a french stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness they have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry dusty theology babette will give everything she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace about sacrifice about how sensual experience as in the bread and wine of the eucharist can change lives and about why true art moves us so deeply when they can forgive each other and themselves they can focus on gods love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present as a minister and an artist i cant recommend a movie more highly true art and true grace,1
a chicago couple dillon and dougherty are falsely accused of killing their daughter people begin to wonder if they did it the police investigate and find suspicious evidence the couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press the cops speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter they are charged and brought to trial they are represented by publicityseeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100000 the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed verdict she didnt do it but he did he goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years  in the last third of the movie with dillon in jail and dougherty wondering what to do next we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couples defense witnesses admit to having lied other facts are brought to light that finally result in dillons release the killer is never found though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp  this is a weeper from beginning to end nothing seems to go right for the couple oh there are a few happy moment maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another but its never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief usually a fade to block follows there isnt necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies although i cant imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer theres plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way theyre told oh but i am fortunes fool romeo cries after killing juliets brother here we have dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor screaming wheres my baby there isnt any ambiguity or irony in the story  as im sure there must have been in the real life events on which its based people are either good or bad here or else theyre bad then they turn good  the film isnt aimed at exploring human quirkiness or the way things work out its aimed at wrenching tears from the audience the actors provide firstrate role models i cant remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears there are rivulets of tears showers of them cascades of them a veritable niagara of them a lake lacrymose of them  well ill give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted dillon and dougherty hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed asner asner is sympathetic to them but he doesnt really accomplish much he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy  learn to live with it which is okay  and because he suffers from colorectal cancer so we can watch him take his medicine double over with pain and finally pass away  whats frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises  the function of gossip in regulating private lives  gossip is a strange thing really if we call it gossip its bad but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable at the very least of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified as i write michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile but gossip isnt all bad either its like water when its properly controlled its a community asset we need gossip to keep each other in line it helps us to maintain public order but like water in a flood or a tsunami it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control  this is a movie thats okay if youre not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature its done so cleverly that given its goal its hard to argue with it,0
to be hones i used to like this show and watch it regularly but now thank god i dont understand why did i watch it sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting tv shows ive ever seen i really dont get the point of this show despite of trying people are saying that sex and the city is funny in what way by cursing all the time talking about vibrators and the size of the penis give me a break  i dont understand the plot we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork who comes around and this show is all about four spoiled chicks who are sleeping with every man in the city but in the end they admit the best pleasure comes out of the penis vibrators and yeah the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship if you can have a good sex youre a good husband or wife it doesnt matter if you want to be loyal and having a good heart the size does matter  the biggest problem is also bad acting the four main actresses sarah jessica parker kim cattral cynthia nixon and kristin davis are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me sick just watching this show parker is just screaming and complaining all the time cattral is showing her old boobs and saying the f  word all the time davis delivers her smile and nothing else and nixon acts like she is bored all the time and yes men are sex  hungry pigs in this show but judging by this show women are not much better this show is insulting for men and women the women are shown so primitive and emotionless like they dont have any heart just hunger for sex its insulting for everyone  sex and the city is one of the worst tv shows and im glad that the show ended because it delivers bad acting and pointless stories the whole world is not all about sex and vibrators,0
can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a south carolina town the answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap james kennedy understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene also the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience coach jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart  radio directed by michael tolllin is a formula film inspired on a true story yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast  coach jones is instrumental in getting the young man who is called radio because his passion for collecting them involved in sports a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life coming from a poor background radio lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coachs intentions radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot at first then his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body  the film owes a lot to ed harris and cuba gooding jr who make a great pair as the coach and radio mr harris one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence he gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past cuba gooding jr is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man  the supporting cast is excellent s ephata merkerson one of the best actresses of her generation does interesting work as the mother of radio alfre woodard another good actress plays the high school principle with style debra winger only has a few scenes in the film  radio while being sentimental will warm anyones heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them michael tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us,1
i dont know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set as it is in the middle of the war macy has returned from the war his neighbor asks hey is it true you got a fritz over there and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses hence the name and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid antisemitism and macy and dern could wrapped up in it funny how neither is jewish in this film but the accusation is made also it is historically accurate as the labor union democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of america and god macy is continually pestered to come to the meeting his presence brings unexpected results  applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast in 2005 has undergone a complete reversal with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their unifier supporting the republican party and viewing organized labor as part of leftwing unpatriotic america  a great picture to watch if you care to see the friendly timid and meek macy played beautifully by him get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40s in nyc  a tough emotionally charged film,1
why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement but im guessing its because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horrorcomedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the backcover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if its as idiotic as the first and has some nice splattergore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong   let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a thirdrate soapopera it has this way too slick shotonvideo look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well dont even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile that jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventhrate chucky from childs play spewing dumb and supposedly witty oneliners before he kills someone  the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the endcredits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all offscreen like ive read in many other comments there were indeed nice setups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled from the backcover of the dvd wasnt even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didnt see sht i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a letdown could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame cause only a decent amount of splatterfun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didnt cut it for me speaking of those snowballs they were done very poorly they made munchies look like stateoftheart animatronics but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost 1996 and youll be okay just bare in mind that its a pretty silly horrorcomedy but fun in its own right  its funny but writerdirector michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2 and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan phillippe and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after all  now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies way to go mr cooney,0
i just found out before writing this review that komodo vs cobra and another movie called curse of the komodo were both directed by the same guy jim wynorski that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises they both feature a militarygoverned island a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok what differences are there well the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and theres a giant cobra on the island as well hence the title komodo vs cobra even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the story komodo vs cobra is more or less what youd expect given its title and its channel origin the scifi channel although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you i liked a movie called komodo i hardly doubt this one will  komodo vs cobra is not only a boring film but its also one of the least enthusiastic scifi flicks ive seen in a long time in some of these movies there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort but i see very little here thats indicated again by it just being a rehash of curse of the komodo the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a secondrate video game the cinematography and misc en scene is poor the acting ranges from passable to poor the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly put unforgivably bad i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this but in this movie where michael par takes a single thirtyeight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading oncewell at first i laughed but even then it just became tiring that would be the action a monster appears people scream par fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture and somebody gets eaten  komodo vs cobra is a very bad movie the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a charitable manner is an actress named michelle borth who is not only very beautiful but a surprisingly strong performer even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given michelle borth managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as junky as this she obviously took it for the paycheck but it wont boost her career any im afraid,0
omg another bad film by larry buchanan that guy did not learn to stop did he first he gives us zero budget scifi movies and lies about famous dead people and now he is exploiting the loch ness monster as being vicious  the plot is basically about some southerners of the usa pretending to be scottish camping out at loch ness alas out on the fishing hole oops i mean lake of loch ness there is a killer inflatable monster that clams itself to be nessie going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason  i am surprised that the crew of mst3k never heard of this movie yes it is that bad too,0
i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie i think the director filmed it in his back yard there was no real plot   terrible script  terrible acting  the worst production i have ever witnessed a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard  i dont normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one  life is to short to waste your time with this movie,0
is this a bad movie dont take my word for it consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie    while he was watching this movie the brain of mr harold faber of sandusky ohio forcibly ejected itself from his skull at over 200 kph and preceded to squirm across the floor shrieking noooo nooo noooo   mrs louise robbins of enid oklahoma a 69yearold retired homemaker committed ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this movie   ms janine hosmer of columbia south carolina gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this movie although she had not been pregnant   while watching this movie together mr and mrs lawrence wells of san franciso california spontaneously exploded with such force that mr wellss left tibia was later found embedded in the wall of a house in marin county  there have been many similar incidents  of those who did not suffers more serious effects such as those detailed above at least 75 became incurably violently and understandably insane after viewing this movie of the remaining 25 most had already been insane before viewing the movie the remainder were either blind andor and deaf or in a persistent vegetative state  im not saying dont rent it if you want to im just reporting what was in the papers,0
based on a william faulkner short story two soldiers is a top notch short film a movie that has enough story emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end the story involves two dirt poor mississippi brothers one only a kid the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the younger brother played brilliantly by newcomer jonathan furr doesnt want to let his older brother go and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the army himself ron perlman gives a gruff but touching peformance as the army colonel who decides to help the kid  because it is only 39 minutes long this gem will be hard to find it will most likely be confined to the festival circuit for now but remember the name aaron schneiderthis picture marks him as a director to watch,1
i was really looking forward to watching this documentary on what i considered to be some of the most entertaining films ever made growing up in la during the 60s many of these old black and white films were shown on the local stations i even remember a friday night show called strange tales of science fiction that showcased a different sci fi flick every week this documentary however spent way too much time on the opinions of the four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic movies of that genre and how they used them as inspiration in their filmaking  that is not what i was hoping for in this documentary it really could have been a comprehensive examination of the decade instead of a brief highlighting of the most well known films of the era anyone who has studied or been interested in these films are pretty familiar with standouts such as war of the worlds forbidden planet the thing the day the earth stood still etc i would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these movies i would have to agree the documentary was way too focused on spielbergs opinions and was a type of commercial for his new release of war of the worlds,1
in the early 00s production companies had a shortlived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after the crimson rivers and brotherhood of the wolf turned out to be hits so several movies were greenlit or saved from their directtovideo fate however france as opposed to the us uk or italy has little tradition of fantasy bmovies and it turned out quickly that samouras bloody mallory or the crimson rivers sequel were illadvised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place as they flopped producers have gone back to their usual fare derivative farces or the umpteenth selfreferential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from les cahiers du cinma  brocliande could only have been greenlit during this short window as it serves no other discernible purpose its your bythebook slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and youll find bimboesque female characters a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you dont even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before even before the movie started  these elements make all the fun of a 70s or a 80s bmovie and you expect them in a 70s or 80s movie however were not in the 80s anymore and nobody warned director doug headline as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80s but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes brocliande a bore  when you put together clichs from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino you get a scream or a death proof movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clichs and add a great deal to them thats called talent and thats why you cant confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago  brocliande takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies unfortunately for the male viewer the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing there are very strong similarities presumably unintentional between the plot of brocliande and the reviled halloween 3 season of the witch as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night as even the plot of halloween 3 makes more sense than this one it means that something seriously wrong went with brocliande,0
if i compare two films with sacha cohen borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better its no master piece but its a film at least borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g  i cannot put my finger on it there something wrong with the ali g script half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old not by an adult scriptwriter and a number of jokes including mr cohens lower body are quite tasteless   but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public sadly true in todays western society people get careers for doing stupid things in public also alis advice about immigrant policy and some others   ali g overall remains a sympathetic character even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age but its ok to watchits quite funny  but never ever watch borat its awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick,0
i am a big fan of horror movies and know a lot of info on serial killers obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating because half of the movie was fictional more than that the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story this movie was awful the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasnt too bad acting horrible actors sub par movie waste of time  a big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie,0
this was obviously the worst movie ever madeketchup was the starring role in this movie and would be the only nominee for an awardcause the plot actors and anything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous i could have made a better horror flick in my backyard within two hours with a handheld camera using grass stuffed dummies as the actors atleast the acting would have been better dont waste your time or money on this oneits extremely cheesy and horrible,0
i really enjoyed the patriot this movie had less violence and was based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization one line in the movie from wesley mclaren seagal stuck out in my mind to be very true of our society western medicine is in the practice of prolonging illness and i am in the business of curing it,1
this movie is really bad the hero cant play you see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart and believe me he walks a lot for 45 min nothing happens he only walks to places and gets out like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring lookslikeasuspens scenes  dialogues are very poor i counted around a lots of hellos and few hang on on the 1st part  blood is orange like the mercurochrome you put on kids blisters and scenes are not following themselves a bloody neck on a scene a clean neck on the following  the story could have been improved yeah i mean what the hell is the story   martial arts where is that martial arts watch how hesitant and slow are the moves if giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts then i am bruce lee  the only good point i have found is on fight scenes  they dont play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies  there are plenty of low budget movies that are great that one was just to make money nothing else,0
i work in an office on weekends and there is a tv that only gets one channel so i dont have the option of turning to something better i keep it on though because it provides a little background noise sometimes i get a decent movieshow not today today i got breaker breaker the city looks like a third rate set which of course it is all the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school i have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival the special effects flames at end of movie are more fake then michael jacksons masculinity even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor a badly acted badly shot badly written movie,0
this movie was a waste of the celluloid it was printed on it is a disastrous scene much like a particularly gruesome train wreck  watching this is like trying to explain the meaning of life the main plot point is that the character played by steve guttenberg is a party animal whos not supposed to gamble because that would violate his parole the kids he befriends refuse to play with him as coach for a while because he gambles but a few minutes later after theyve won the championship a large sum of money saves their shelter and where did they get the money gambling add this to the creepy scenes at the funeral home why exactly are there bedrooms in a funeral home and the useless peripheral character,0
visually this film is interesting light is literally thrown in a way together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles that had my hopes up at the start but then  a bmovie is a bmovie is a bmovie no matter how much spectacle is seen this film surrounds the life of albert fish one of the most wellknown serialkillers in the world active around the start of the 20th century fishs life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age this film is based upon two tracks fishs life and that of william f king lead investigator of the case what saves this film from becoming a hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort whenever films about serial killers are concerned is the direction which is a doubleedged sword director scott l flynn sheds focus enough upon the bactors not to let their flaws shine through too much but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the american police through the kingangle sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with fishs meet with grace budd the 10yearold girl that he killed even though im not really sure if her mother was the mediacrazed person that flynn really tries to emphasise that she was i miss more psychological diving into fish not to mention the very little time which was spent on fishs postcapture all in all interesting for those who are into serialkillers but mostly a letdown however if the director will make another film about another serialkiller id definitely see it in hopes that holes were patchedup,0
i was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull her hair out in frustration through most of this movie i thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the dairy barn any minute so i cheated grabbed the remote and was relieved to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes i should have turned the channel cute it had potential but yuck,0
those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow belongs to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else fortunately human nature is much deeper than that loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering  though if we are fortunate only on their death  this film is true in setting atmosphere and dialogue to nigel balchins original novel a way through the wood and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives and the depiction of english upper class country life is very accurate  i loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an ukcompatible dvd,1
the chemistry between sally hawkins and elaine cassidy was incredible they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles imelda staunton played the conniving mrs sucksby brilliantly despite the fact that she was a dastardly opportunist she somehow managed to have you sympathizing with her in the end rupert evans played the slimeball gentleman with sheer charm and snark he was a scene stealer the story itself was very unique as was the manner in which it was told the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb,1
this film is supposed to be about the frustrations of film making it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom the setting is an attractive spanish seacoast resort with his usual large cast the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script just all adlib  a far superior film about the frustrations of film making is francois truffauts day for night made in 1973 it shows all the delays and how the cast can misbehave in an intriguing manner it doesnt bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film,0
the tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with art to more postmodern approaches that like to dissect the play along postcolonial feminist gender or deconstructionist lines the reason why jarmans version left me fairly cold is that i didnt have a clue what he was on about what is the underlying visionideaconcept behind this rendering of shakespeare the previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy punk show but surely there is more to it isnt there this is not to say that there is no vision here just that i was hard put to discover it be that as it may there are still things to enjoy the punk flavour is refreshing and funny toyah wilcox as miranda and jack birkett as caliban are wonderful i did not much care about williams as prospero  not enough magic i suppose the switches between the old monasterycastle and the very english world outside can be a little unsettling at times but i guess that is intentional all in all interesting but not quite the success i had hoped it might be particularly after seeing jarmans caravaggio,1
typical story of an evil kid going after people i suspect that antonio fargas huggy bear on starsky and hutch and vincent schiavelli didnt want to stress this junk on their resumes actually schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume sometimes i wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month note that comment is not to be taken seriously i just think that slashers have lost their touch  anyway this is one movie that youll do best to avoid its ninety minutes to two hours that ill never get back,0
this film is completely underrated  its a film similar to will keenan and patrick hassons waiting as well as adrien brodys restaurant and the classic film breaking away which are all about young adults who are stuck and know theyre stuck with little or no chance of breaking free  death by pizza delivered is about an intelligent freethinking artistic young adult will played by david strictland who is stuck and waiting bitter at the worlds hypocrisy and bitter at his own lack of direction and desire will meets his nemesis reed ron eldard another intelligent young adult whos so bitter hes chosen the path of crime both end up helping each other to free themselves of their bitterness which enables them to get unstuck  for these young adults getting unstuck or breaking free can mean both forging ahead into life and plunging downward into death  wills life is filled with the trademarks of a young stuck adult a soulsucking sweaty underpaying job crude customers an exgirlfriend who left him because he was unmotivated a partial college education with no degree a house filled with selfmade art and of course the new friend whose ungodly choices help him to save himself,1
a fantastic cinema experience i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out there is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isnt accepted by the ampas american academy after roles in such films as tom jones murder on the orient express under the volcano to name only few  for these he was nominated for the oscar the dresser is arguably his highlight yet  i know oscars are just popularity contest but if americans like british actors and actresses and the oscar goes to jeremy irons daniel daylewis anthony hopkins emma thompson glenda jackson etc  and they all deserved the award why they always left sir finney with empty hands  on the other hand they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei in cousin vinny i dont know should i laugh or cry  if you have seen the two leads in the dresser you wont forget what is the art of acting watch this film and enjoy i recommend it to everyone who loves art  i give 910 for this excellent film 1 point missing for noncinematic material after all it is just a theater  note my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb 10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that shouldcould last forever,1
in 60s hong kong a man and woman move in the same day into adjacent apartments with their respective spouses soon they suspect their ever absent spouses of having an affair with oneanother a strange bond emerges between the man and woman as they cope with their sadness by taking turns playing each others spouse before a more complex bond emerges  no summary can do it justice for hong kong auteur wong karwais in the mood for love is nothing short of a miracle a story about sadness that manages to be touching and at times funny a romance that never feels forced or fake no doubt the directors method has a lot to do with that  directed from an inexistent screenplay though the concept largely flows from a japanese short story to favor improvisation the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of its performances all the film revolves around that and the rest is pure enhancement at the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll maggie cheung and tony leung are simply amazing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display the additional material is also topnotch the films is magnificent to behold in part lensed by heros christopher doyle and the music is heartbreaking  this is something everybody must see if only because it is by far the most heartfelt mature and authentic love story out there unmissable,1
if you are one of those people that think lucio fulci is all about gore guts and zombies you have to watch this and the psychic too for that matter even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence and a unsettling subject matter its not the main thing here this is a truly impressive story and characterdriven murder mystery that might well be the directors masterpiece here he proves that hes a real craftsman creating a memorable disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with creepy catholic imagery and interesting social commentary it also has a great cast including the gorgeous barbara bouchet as well as tomas millan from beatrice cenci and irene pappas in a small but important role still it is brazilian actress florinda bolkan who also stared in fulcis bizarre lizard in a womans skin who steals the scene in the role of majara giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking the second star of the movie is sergio dofizis cinematography who along with the melancholic morriconeesquire score by riz ortolani help bringing the secluded italian village with a dark secret setting to life i have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off but nonetheless this is a definite italian horror classic  a moving sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius 1010 for me if you liked this one i recommend watching alfred soles alice sweet alice as they are somewhat similar and are both underrated gems,1
my jaw fell so many times watching this flick i have bruises okay granted i really wasnt expecting the quality of say the others or even thirteen ghosts the new one which was just dreadful and is still head and shoulders above this insanity someone else noted the thin charactersi wouldnt call them thin thin implies there might be something to them how about almost nonexistent in no particular order we have the girl who will scream the american who will figure it all out the macho guy who will just bull through everything until he gets killed the wise black man who will die early the extra guy who is there to die first the extra woman who is there to play tough thats it thats your character list and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end if they were thin they might at least change a little bit from beginning to end but they dont well okay the american guy decides hes going to stay with the fieldwork at the end and the screaming girl goes back to wherever she came from thats the change other than that they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotion when they finally meet up with the menace  now the producers get props for an original menace i will say i had understood the story was going to be tremors but with ants instead of giant worms i give the writer credit these are very cool very scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent the first time the bone snatcher appear i admit i jumped a few feetunfortunately the very cool concept becomes alien in the desert very quickly we get a lot of commentary on ants that may or may not be true but we dont get much of the mythology on which the menace is based and we get every monster movie clich ever made people go into places they know they shouldnt and when they have no compelling reason to moronic characters try to hinder our heroes and die for it one character does double duty as scientist who doesnt want to kill the monster but study it a very cool gadget is introduced only so the american can tell everyone something about ants that gee i hope everyone knows anyway then the gadget is broken our heroes run out of the one thing that can keep the menace at bay and then there is that final annoying moment when we know the menace is still with usand wonder exactly what and how the hey the hero or heroine came by it it completely renders everything that went before as useless and false  three stars for the cool use of ants and bones nothing at all for clichs clunky dialogue and dim bulb characters,0
i havent seen this film for over 20 years but it had such an impact on me that i remember sitting through the credits and for several minutes after in complete awe this is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released i just ordered a copy of it on dvd and paid for overnight shipping and cant wait for it to arrive it is uplifting at times and also very dark and somewhat disturbing its a story of a closeknit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines rather than watching on a movie screen or television hard to explain but it is something that must be experienced the story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life the entire cast did an incredible job and its by far the best work of jodi thelens career im hoping that the dvd lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this friday with a good friend,1

having never actually seen anything by this beloved of the luvvies let alone a production of merchant of venice i cant comment on how faithful it is to previous adaptations of the play so i will treat it as just another movie that tries to be more than novocaine for the eye mov is an instantly gripping movie about a young lover bassanio fiennes and his merchant friend antonio irons and a jewish money lender shylock pacino  plot summary  bassiano is broke and needs money to woo the lovely portia collins he goes to his friend antonio who sypathises with his friends predicament so borrows some money off shylock  now antonio does not like jews in general and shylock in particular and shylock bitter and twisted from the abuse he has suffered from antonio in particular and christians in general agrees to lend antonio the money on condition that if antonio does not repay the loan by the agreed deadline shylock will cut a pound of flesh from antonios body   comment  the movie is breathtakingly beautiful and acted and spoken in such a way as to force you to think about what each line means this in turn causes the viewer to gain insights into the characters and their motivations  it seems to me to be a movie about the choices that shylock makes and how making wrong choices leads to shylocks ruin  from the moment shylock demands his pound of flesh he is doomed for rest of the world is against him and connives to bring about his downfall  this disturbed me greatly normally in a movie when a victim gets a chance of revenge against those who have harmed him either the victim succeeds or makes the villain see the error of his ways leading to a big hug  not in mov the victim quickly becomes seen as the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith  this movie is a powerful and subtle portrayal of casual anti semitism which shows how a whole society can turn on a minority and make it seem like the victim is really the offender  i was blown away by this movie 1010,1
ramin bahrani sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of ale alejandro polanco and his friend were coming from the two of them get on a subway and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyones attention for a moment and that they are selling candy bars or mms or something and then they proceed to sell some bars if you as i have ever been on a subway in new york city at any time this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost dont notice it often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind bahranis focus isnt necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america it is subsequently in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking usually at once  to compare it to pixote or the bicycle thief isnt too far of a leap actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other though bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style we care about this character ali no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him but its not simply because were forcefed any clichs aside from you know a brother and sister moreso the brother trying to take care of one another bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration ali has the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and isamar can operate themselves  its all ali is working for but what bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work what ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in shea stadium or at one point stealing a purse in a desperate moment this makes it all the more serious an issue when ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road he doesnt mention it and pushes it aside but its always something that adds to the tension something ale wants to protect his sister from it adds to the tragedy when ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profitmaker a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes  one could look immediately at the fact that ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in naturally as with a work of neoneo realism lets just call it realism featuring practically all nonprofessional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets but bahrani is focused moreso on the here and the now and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt not a trace of melodrama is in the film barely even music accompaniment aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and radios sometimes bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes like the way ale is awake but acts like hes asleep the first night after he witnesses isamars latenight tryst and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows hes awake but neither can say a word or in a lot of other scenes poetic touches that seem seamless like when the man shows ale how feeding the pigeons work  its rough and gritty as you can expect and it doesnt give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about its also a superbly shot handheld film where the technique as with a lot of movies made in its urbanset tone and approach informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what theyre doing but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy the filmmaker has a superb reallife cast ale was plucked from a nyc public school without any experience and knows how to not waste a shot while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows its not city of god or pixote its its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to or a first one barely on our way in a city such as new york if youre not moved by ale and his daily struggles i dont know what to do for you,1
hlots was an outstanding series its what nypd blue will never be on hlots the plots are real the dialog is real the relationships are real with hlots back as a movie tying up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up wont say how the storyline was fast paced emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out homicide  life on the streets network drama at its best 5 stars thumbs up and all that thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didnt get,1
i just do not see what is so bad about this movie i loved this movie i thought this movie was the best film in the series though part 3 is the best in the seriesi still gave this film 10 out of 10 because it is great i dont see what everyone hates this movie who would not want to see just a little bit of critter action i wished that brad brown would of appeared in this one because it might of made it a little better those who like a little bit of drama becausewait i wont tell youyou will just have to watch it this film also contains a few popular actors who arei wont tell you because i hate it when people give spoilers so i do not want to be one of those people well i guess that is all i have to say about this movie,1
plunkett  macleane falls into my favourite genre of film historical action adventure with comedy which is probably why i rate it so highly  the action centres around a highwayman plunkett and a layabout gentleman who gets entangled with him and his schemes macleane this leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy there is also of course a love interest  the rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time  this is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment,1
anatomie anatomy is an entertaining and engaging film that falls short of delivering the discomfort that should be connected with the films subject matter the idea of ethical ignorance in the medical science world is one that pushes the viewer towards discomfort and the realism of the institutions heidelberg and the special effects make it a notentirely easy film to watch  however the characters the script and the gloss of the film all seem too familiar with the scream movies that repopularised this sort of genre sadly then whilst the subject is one to care about the viewer is presented with another movie full of college student characters that we dont really get a chance to care about unresolved subplots and hammy stagekillings that have been reinventing themselves since the memorable drew barrymore opening scene in scream several years back  steven ruzowillzky makes a fair effort of the script and the direction but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme whilst we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances we are unfortunately left with the old feeling nothing is wrong with this film but nothing is extraordinary either  an entertaining film and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by the postscream horror culture 6 out of 10,1
i remember this movie getting a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new letterman and leno themselves had objections letterman called it paraphrasing the biggest waste of film hed ever seen and leno objected to the simpleton portrayal of himself but letterman had john michael higgins as a guest on his show so it seems he didnt take anything too personally a dvd rerelease with opinions and such from those involved could be interesting though i suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon  i preferred the letterman impersonation to the leno but could never buy in to either they never rose above caricature and i never simply accepted them as actors for comparison paul sorvino as kissinger in oliver stones nixon comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off  the highlight of the show for me was treat williams as michael ovitz williams speech to letterman was not as great as but reminiscent of alec baldwins entrance and quick exit as blake in glengerry glen ross  they could have done more with johnnys role in all this i know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that johnny carson needs no introduction but more context about why dave and jay and all comedians revere johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip film  guess i should read the book  rich little imitating johnny carson unfortunately came across as nothing more than rich little imitating johnny carson  i tell you what after watching this movie then watching either the letterman or leno show all i want to do is crack open my johnny carson dvds and see the real thing,1
the frustrating thing about a movie like this with a true potential for greatness is that it almost enjoys being heavyhanded we speak of allegory of metaphorbut the truth is theres no getting around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character  at a certain point we most know who the people areeven if we never understand where they are going the sheer pretentiousness wore me down every time i tried to grasp a truth in this film  call it beautiful great and awesomei just call it cheating all style and no substance sure its a matter of tastebut i would never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes over the spiritual clarity of jean cocteau or renoir but if it works for you im all for it art is a personal thing i guess,0
hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever cannonite review show my movie for this week was debatable what route what movie what excellent four star epic would i choose guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route ive decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam tiller eileen seeley as anne tiller marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners sean patrick murphy as captain fun ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost  its hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frostloved the carrot scenebut its even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror moviethe only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder sam tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie his wife however was one of the few bright spots she played her role as the main woman to a hilt she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given if it wasnt for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chuckyfreddy and jason laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk he had humor and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak  this movie could have been so much more it could have been a continuation of a great franchise instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled  this movie gets a two out of ten for me and its lucky that it even gets a one,0
i just saw this film again i believe for the sixth time i will doubtless see it many more times this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made although the film is mysterious even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director gilles mimouni for ten years he has not made another film and this was his only one the story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect and it is clearly paying homage continually to both hitchcock and buster keaton the splitsecond timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on keaton in steamboat bill junior and he is only not killed by inches in this film people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares and if they had been one second off they would have collided the storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond or you will miss something crucial the haunting albeit intentionally repetitive music by peter chase is reminiscent of hitchcocks vertigo and the whole film has the same eerie quality but whereas hitchcock had one woman be two women mimouni has two women be one woman thereby inverting the plot structure there are passing references to other hitchcock films but it is vertigo which is central to the inspiration of this film the theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events the invisible threads behind the tapestry the ineffable everything is hypercharged with passionate love and desire but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object that is why it is so easily transferable from lisa to alice when it is realised that it is alice who is more mysterious than lisa and it is alice who truly embodies the eternal mystery the film is ultimately made by romane bohringer she is so fascinating that she outshines monica bellucci which is really something to pull off considering that bellucci is a knockout beauty whereas bohringer is what the english call plain however romane bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the art of personality dominance whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and dont get noticed because romane is being so fascinating you cant take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls and you end up only thinking of her most of us remember im sure her father richard bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film diva many years ago i would rather watch romane than richard lying in a bathtub but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating because richard bohringer is spellbinding too and he isnt even a woman romane looks as if she may turn into anna magnani when she is much older and that means she will get an oscar if someone can only write another rose tattoo for her the girl has so much passion inside her she could set the seine on fire wouldnt it be wonderful if she and julie delpy teamed up this film made wonderful use of paris locations but where is this square in the luxembourg it looked like place furstenburg to me maybe i missed something i must watch the film another six times just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom and make sure ive got it right the whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster how thrilling it all is romane you can look through my window anytime mimouni come on over lets discuss impossibilities unlikelihoods coincidence synchronicity everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible and once again we have here the spirit of bretons novel nadja embodied in a great french work of art more more more,1
in the aftermath of september 11th in new york this drama about american firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism the story is told with a series of flashbacks where after firefighter jack morrison joaquin phoenix has crashed through the floor of a burning building and only communicating with captain mike kennedy john travolta via the radio the flashbacks basically show how jack grows from being a recruit seeing kennedy as a father figure to being a firehouse legend of course in the present day jacks fellow firefighters are trying to reach him but they are too late and in the end he lets them leave him and it forwards to his funeral where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known also starring jacinda barrett as linda morrison terminator 2s robert patrick as lenny richter morris chestnut as tommy drake billy burke as dennis gauquin balthazar getty as ray gauquin and tim guinee as tony corrigan the blazes of the film are ultimately all i could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking adequate,0
i enjoy films of various kinds and qualities whether its your typical standard hollywood action movie or your oscar season tearjerker movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me  in soap girl i received nothing but confusion first we meet maya a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the customers in the parlor a virgin poet named harry comes in one day and they fall in love after that there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which seem to lead nowhere  although many have commented on the controversial issue of an asian prostitute being exploited by the white man keep in mind that this film was made by an asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue but whether he succeeds or not does not matter for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not  for me soap girl fails to meet the standard i expect from movies it was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie given the loose plot and the mediocre acting worse it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama when the tone falls more towards comedy  a movie such as soap girl which fails to trap me into the magic of cinema will always leave me bored throughout the movie i couldnt help but think what is this really about a movie has to answer that question before it is made if not what youll end up with is an empty push to captivate the audience  grade d,0
so far i disliked every single jean rollin movie ive seen and that always bothered me because hes an acclaimed eurotrash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website people whose opinions i always value and usually concur with apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me rollins movies are unimaginably boring they all feature the same basic concept lesbian vampires in various settings the dialogs are incredibly absurd the marvelous gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket i had actually given up on rollins repertoire already especially after enduring the iron rose until i found out about night of the hunted allegedly this movie doesnt feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists and the verdict is  yes and no on one hand this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive rollin film i had the pleasure of seeing thus far and also the only one that i watching without dozing off on the other hand it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness jean rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasnt got a story to tell at all the unearthly beautiful lead actress brigitte lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen during a nightly drive back home to paris a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods her name is elisabeth but furthermore she cant remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up the next day shes kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive elisabeth knows nothing but she does sense she needs to escape from here obviously i wont reveal the denouement but i can assure you it is quite dumb illogical and farfetched apparently rollin realized this as well because the explanation is kept very brief and quick theres a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion the nasty makeup effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose as said the score is mesmerizing and brigitte lahaies perfect body is addictive to glaze at,0

a long time ago way back in the early 80s a latenight tv show fridays came to abc trying to steal the limelight away from nbcs badlylisting saturday night live it didnt but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semitalented comedians to the world like mark blankenfield for example  which in a roundabout way brings us to jekyll and hyde together again which is repugnant in ways all its own  blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion and about as tasteful too this is just his druggedout druggist character he played on the illfated fridays show stretched out to feature length and if you didnt like him there why are you reading this review  any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie thats a bad sign then when it goes for dunderheaded jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with grossout things can only get worse  a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poes fall of the house of usher  aside from a few very few gags that give a slight grin this whole film is an exercise in waste  wasted actors wasted film wasted opportunities  no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave what more observant a review could they give themselves  no stars no not even for armstrong who should have known better   hyde from this one,0
mild spoiler in the second paragraph  anna christie was garbos lackluster 1st talkie she and dressler look like the only people who know what theyre doing in this movie the old guy who plays garbos dad george f marion in the film is soooo ahnoying all he does is stumble around drunkenly in a totally fake way and yell about dat old dahveel sea he blames garbos past his whole life and everything on the sea he comes across as stupid x 10 charles bickford is matt the rough n tumble sailor garbo falls in love with and hes fine in his role but nothing really outstanding  the best part is when garbo unleashes her terrible secret on bickford and her dad finally marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with bickford then soon he goes on a tirade about the sea  i had to practically force myself to finish anna christie its too melodramatic in many parts and creaky there are many good early talkies but this is not one of them if you havent seen garbo before try something else before anna christie like camille or grand hotel,0
usa the movie is like this you take a nap on a long hot sunday afternoon it feels great to close your eyes and let your worries drift away soon youre lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know youre dreaming but you still cant wake upnot that you want to you go with the flow and soon youre in a kind of weird alice in wonderland story complete with characters you didnt think you could dream up theyre telling you all kinds of crazy stuff about war and peace while taking you through a trip into the past and even the future   the dream starts to get heavier and you feel like its going down a path you cant control maybe you want to wake up so you try to open your eyes but you cant  now theres destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what could be truth or could be lies youre seeing images that flicker and change and then get clear but do you even want to see what youre brain is creating for you   finally youre lost in a myth world and you realize the end has come the end of the world and the end of the dream its over what do you wake up to what do you do next   maybe youll write down that dream because you know dreams like dont happen too often and when they do you better pay attention   or maybe youll crack a beer and forget the whole thing bad idea dont forget,1
i was in blockbuster and i saw a film called dark harvest the cover art looked great the plot wasnt that bad and the tagline you reap what you sow made the movie look pretty good but i was dumb that day because i did something i should have never done i rented a straight to video independent horror film walking out with my much better rentals i went home popped dark harvest in the dvd player and it began i figured i would watch the trailer after the film was done bad idea but went ahead and watched it anyway now to the reviewpossible spoilers first off the acting by the kids sucks and the scene when the 2 main characters are talking the lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake now they go to this house where sean connels i think hes the main character i dont care relatives lived there all of a sudden one by one they all start getting killed bygasp a killer scarecrow ahhh the scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake its hilarious it makes dinosaur noises and everything and then at the endthey shoot the scarecrow with a gun that is red for gods sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar and it pauses for a while and thengasp blows up  save yourself some time im telling you this movie sucks if you need to pass an hour and a half look at the wall because looking at the wall is a fun compared to this disaster it is quite funny though  overall grade f if there was anything lower f than i would give it that,0
i havent reviewed anything on here for quite awhile but after having the misfortune to sit through this rubbish masquarading as entertainment i had to put forward my thoughts  normally however bad something is there is one redeeming part whether it is an actor who was okay a scene that was passable an attractive cast member or a general feelgood moment unfortunately that isnt true here as the film starts of atrociously with a ridiculous shootout which was so poor i thought it was a practice  two halfwits otherwise known as the boys in blue chatting beside a school  one of these idiots was daniel baldwin who not only starred in this but also actually directed this garbage  unlike his brothers cannot act for toffee not that he was on his own here as everyone in it seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimp  luckily certainly for me i only watched an hour of this masterpiece as the dvd wouldnt work  was probably made by the same fools who produced this so if you have nothing to do but watch paint dry do watch this as it is just as boring  ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests,0
the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie this was a good rendition of the story i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story but the second half was horrible yes there were violent aspects of this story but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the israelites towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god this rendition had some huge problems with deviation from scripture and big surprise there are no favorable deviations their portrayal of moses as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false it showed a moses who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him wrong the scripture says god spoke to moses all the time and not just after a temper tantrum they got the peoples complaining right but failed to show that god spoke to moses at sinai in an audible voice that the followers could hear and believechapter 19 they also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and night  what was the whole joshua thing the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until moses threatens him wrong he was known as a great warrior what about the great speech that moses gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own wrong they only won through gods help as shown in their own scenes with moses lifting his staffand what was that sorry looking ark of the covenant instead of overlaying it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it oh yeah it was a molten calf not a straw one with little chips tacked on someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians you wouldnt know it from this sorry looking bunch  by the way the part about them slaying the israelites after the golden calf incident says men and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers oh yeah  manna wasnt the only thing sent from heaven  dont forget the birds for meat also the bible mentions jethro bringing moses his wife and children and then says jethro went back to his own land it does not say that moses gave up his family  oh well if you know nothing about the real story read exodus for yourself if you know the real story you will hate this version,0
imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect now imagine something infinitely darker  i mean worse than that then multiply that by the quantity of the suckiness possessed by the star wars holiday special this movie is by far worse than that  dracula 3000 infinite darkness starring such illustrious and reputable actors such as coolio and langley kirkwood as the films horrifying antagonist count orlock is equatable to eating ones own feces exclusively for ones entire life condensed into approximately one hour and twenty minutes to be frank there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy  riddled with communist propaganda promotion of drug use futuristic anachronisms and quite possibly the worst special effects since the original war of the worlds  the hammer and the sickle of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the dingy sets they dare call a spaceship lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the film and of course religion has been abolished for two centuries by then so they dont know who this god is even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain but of course in the socialist republic of space presided over by interstellar president baker deathstick like drugs are legalized and quite common yet handicap mobility seems even worse off than it is today they dont even have a wheelchair ramp  racial tension still festers throughout the galaxy in quite a familiarpredictable fashion we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as is dracula a brotha us brothas gotta stick together and once you go black you dont go back speaking of the token black characters one is played by coolio playing a stereotypical stoner coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever oh wait second most ridiculous vampire ever that prized title goes to our friend count orlock from planet transylvania in the carpathian system these two make quite a pair between coolios attempts to cripple a paraplegic strange attempts at making highpitched animal noises a hairstyle 1004 years old and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue and count orlocks twenty dollar generic halloweenstyle vampire costume exploding coffins or confusingly inane back story  one wonders if they did not simply give coolio the opportunity to get as high as a kite in space without gravity let him interact with the other actors and just went from there  count orlocks motivations are also somewhat in question does he want infinite darkness as the films subtitle would have you believe does he want to eat the crew or does he want coolio to kill them all or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an inhospitably future it doesnt really matter because none of this films plot makes sense anyways  the highlight of this movie has to be its ending more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt trainwreck of a climax they phone in before the credits instead of facing count orlock off in some sort of duel the closest we get is a shot of orlock flailing around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist who dies shortly afterwards our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door orlock then proceeds to collapse screeching in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury this is by far the most fun youll get from this movie watching a vampires contorted face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat  with laughter almost worth the four bucks for that alone of course right after that were treated with one of the films worst oneliners the mandatory allusion to sex and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending ever theyre driving into the sun and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact i think they just outdid the wachowski bros for the worst finale ever  i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible secure in this fact we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created and one which will never be exceeded in low quality lower budget and lowerest acting talent,0
tromeo  juliet  10th anniversary edition  william shakespeares play romeo  juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films sometimes literally following the original text which is at times vague in stage directions sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece some are good many are mediocre lloyd kaufmans film certainly stands out as one of the most original modern versions of the bards creation it may be placed in a modernday decaying new york and full of the modernday antisocial behavior body piercing dismemberment and kinky sex which for the more than casual reader shakespeare himself wasnt shying away from but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about which is quite an effort kaufman wrote the script with his codirector on the film james gunn who is now famous for writing two successful scooby doo movies doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for dawn of the dead and directing one of the best horrorfilms of the year slither lloyd kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with james gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of shakespeares play that maybe not everyone will get immediately but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play with a script that is written entirely in iambic meter appearances of motorheads lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching tromeo  juliet is something no one will ever forget apart from its historical significance tromeo  juliet is a treasure for filmlovers of all kind not only for the script by james gunn now a good influence on hollywood while working from the inside but also because it features an early part of legendary actress debbie rochon well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets the 10th anniversary edition on dvd adds to all that by including so many asyet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the dvd but also a very honest and disturbing look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days in many ways the extras on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on kaufmans filmschool make your own damn movie furtermore historical items from the troma vaults which include james gunn debbie rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included and the film itself is apart from looking better then ever accompanied by no less than four audiocommentaries each and everyone informative excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days there are new commentaries one with kaufman and gunn together but also the one james gunn did for the original release of the dvd but couldnt be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc with fanrecreations of a few of the scenes from the film a video diary of lloyd kaufmans visit to the set of james gunns slither and a visit the two brought together to eli roths hostel birthday party and much more this is the ultimate set everyone must own weather you are a film historian someone interested in interpretations of the great bards work a fan of great cinema a fighter for independent cinema a fan of james gunn interested in learning more on making films on a low budget a fan of lloyd kaufman or whatever this is the most important dvdrelease of this millennium,1
i cant really criticize this film it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals fortunately seeing it again years later it held up fairly well rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths no one believes him including his best friend played by cesar romero whose brother was among those killed and rod cameron was the only survivor the film was shot in india and has some good scenery the acting is on a high level i dont believe rod cameron cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance the mammoths when they finally arrive are fairly effective the ending also has an unusual twist particularly for a 1950s science fiction film definitely worth seeing,1
i saw this performance on tv and taped it my daughter played it over and over again i loaned out at work and everyone just loved it it is just brilliant physical comedy bill made an appearance here in california he was working and living in new york and performed the regard of flight on stage i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance  bill was awarded a federal endowment and my daughter wrote him a letter of congratulations and bill was so kind to write her a note back and enclose a photograph  people ask me and i cant decide if he is a comedian and actor or a clown actually he is all three i really wish this was on dvd my tape is lost,1
like the previous commentator on this film i too found myself in tears at times during this movie sometimes one wonders how a film of such aweinspiring awfulness comes into existence from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses what irish emigrant hasnt had that one its clear we are in trouble and it doesnt get much better  whisked back to 1950s ireland we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forgetthe civil war every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war  the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house prices if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into irelands obsession with its past it fails miserably it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nations psyche  for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland it doesnt 1950s ireland was a horrible poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves however there was more than one topic of conversation,0
now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie but then again we were teenagers but honestly not that good of a movie in retrospect sort of a hair metal dokken version of carnival of souls but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable however this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains but if it was on cable and i was bored and drinking beersure id watch it again but then again ive watched howling vii about five times now so maybe you really shouldnt be listening to me  anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie and why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much,0
countless historical  cultural mistakes 010  1 a jewish guy named omar hahahaha 2 brilliant detective was taking out by the least intelligent guy in the movie 3 jewish suicide bombers that was funny 4 hitler and his top guns went to watch a movie downtown paris with two guards at the door  shoot me 5 brad pitt overacted and it was painful to watch him 6 mr qt is rewriting history hitler was killed in a theatre really the funny thing about this is that people and i mean stupid people will actually believe this plot   and finally can any one tell me how this movie made it to the top 250 movies of all time shame shame shame still wondering how can anyone like this movie,0
one more classic performance by maniratnam and his team they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic the war and its impacts in sri lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry music by ar rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times,1
i ended up liking this movie but it was not the easiest to get through what makes the movie great is the music and the scenery the songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented a great job was done to show different settings for the rom people  however the viewer was not guided enough a more in depth history of the rom people would have been nice only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given english subtitles in addition more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too it would have helped if there were a narrator too explain about customs dress and music,1
alexander nevsky marked director sergei eisensteins return to filmmaking after a period of exile and what he produced is a baldfaced propaganda film proclaiming russias superiority over germany  theres very little plot russians unite to battle germans russia wins the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes mixed in with some moments of german brutality like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire this was eisensteins first sound film and its clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium indeed this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added there are some dialogue scenes but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen and the pacing is all off as if the actors werent actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing prokofiev score over the proceedings and indeed thats one of the films biggest assets  say what you will about eisensteins ability or lack of to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect and alexander nevsky over all shines through its deficiencies  grade a,1
i think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the east german regime  the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its antifascist protective wall it is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed i would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape it did not happen in or around berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the berlin wall the escape balloon was flown over the iron curtain which not only divided germany but it divided the whole of europe at that time the balloon took off from pssneck 170 miles southwest of berlin in the german democratic republic east germany and flew 14 miles to naila in bavaria and freedom in west germany the opening of the iron curtain in hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the berlin wall later that year whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from east berlin other parts of the gdr or other sovietcontrolled states,1
the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only star power if we can call it that consists of joe estevez i dont know what is more shocking the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it if you ever see the cover of the video youll be able to read them someone even went as far as saying that the actresswriter could be the leading lady of the 90s yeah and joe estevez could have more money than his brother martin if you want to check it out anyways i highly recommend watching the mts version of it at least youll laugh a lot without going insane,0
this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life from the opening 10 minutes i was ready to leave the cliches there slapping you in the face and the plot was not only predictably stupid but full of more holes than swiss cheese i am considering suing for that lost 2 hours and 625 along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film the trexs must be flipping in their graves so to speak,0
this movie has everything typical horror movies lack although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for jackzilla dare i say oscar winner this is a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person,1
this film certainly wasnt very sophisticated no the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that i think about it but also while i think of it i did laughproving decent comedy doesnt need to be very deep  fatty arbuckle is the definite star of this short despite buster keatons appearing in the film as well he is the butcher in an oldtime grocery store a lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and i think i laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequenceyoull just have to see it yourself  anyway later fattys girlfriend is forced to go to a girls school and because he cant stand to part he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school arbuckle is one ugly woman so for silly and unsophisticated fun see this film it wont change your life and is a very slight picture but its also fun,1
the game was made in 1996 but it is still good today the graphics is not that hot and the actors are not oscarworthy but the plot is twisted diabolic and highly enjoyable the dark story is compelling from the first film and is continuing throughout all the play we played several people together for several reasons 1 to use all our minds together 2 not to be so afraid  play this game and you wont regret this just dont try to find a quake engine in there,1
excellent and highly underrated from beginning to end one of olivers best well scripted directed shot acted and stuarts copelands soundtrack trivia the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90s pop hit by spacehog band   eric and cast are brilliant let alone the callers what a whirlwind of emotions it makes your hair stand on end necks will be broke and whips will crackin a old female southern accent yike creepy scary than any horror movie  10 out of 10  em,1
a barefaced ripoff of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes the word predictable must have invented for just such an occasion as this lambert is wooden as always his moments of emotion are laughable as is his accent the climax is not that at all as weve had so many signals and by the end were simply immune to flesh rotting and otherwise altogether a real mess,0
im lucky enough to have a good quality copy of my vhs on dvd so i can now watch this over and over again the characters are so well played i cant find fault with any aspect of the casting ok so there are a few differences from the book but the old clich of love conquering all is so powerfully portrayed that it makes no difference the reality of living in the rural countryside of early 19th century england is beautifully contrasted by the changing seasons from biting winter to glorious summer days and this is mirrored in the different characters from prues bullying father to kesters all encompassing love a story that changed my life,1
this 1hour 30minute inside joke is best understood by catholics the number one religion of selfmedicating comedians the world over that isnt to say it cant stand on its own which it does that the film isnt without its flaws which its got technical issues mostly belief that in 1998 digital was the answer when in fact it was in its infancy  a beta of a beta if you will and remastering will never improve it for the love of god halplease get yourself a red one or three  if you like hartley films of course youll like it i liked it because i liked grimfool and there were added benefits of retrospect i couldnt help noticing a disturbing selfprophecy an airliner soaring overhead used as a harbinger of armageddon in this 1998 movie it was as if cheney had gotten the whole idea from hal its true  hartley moves his players round into the camera like its the house of commons just one piece of the gimmickry that needs a rest after all were already paying attention to the actors and the writing is alive not great writing butfervent can i use the word fervent purposeful intelligent not condescending  absolutely love pj harvey in this course id love her anywhere oddly if helen mirren needs a younger self she should look harvey up and bring a bottle of blond,1
this film is well cast often silly and always funny lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director from the first hare krishna to the last you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy,1
once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled an american werewolf in london sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again an american werewolf in paris is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scotts performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scotts deceased friends whos soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends okay guys see ya what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scotts mysterious european love interest basically shes a french girl playing the french girl it isnt much of a stretch but all this stupidity isnt even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles its still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolfs catacombs lair here its much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you dont look on this film as a sequel its not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesnt want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film i  dont care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped american werewolf in london as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time okay guys see ya terrible 3 out of a possible 10 th,0
could this be one of the earliest colour films its actually the second this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison this was one of many of his other films  i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around which turns red with the film its just beautiful  you are watching history when you watch this you are watching what began to make movies of the day great this may not have a plot or anything very interesting but this is the second colour film ever  i recommend this to everyone especially if youre teaching students about filming or something of the sort you have to show them what began color films,1
normally i hate period films living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas  which i do however this one is the best it doesnt take itself seriously and jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are great together liv tylers good as well although her english accent is dodgy  the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves it has action adventure drama and comedy im not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film it shows that english filmmakers can produce something that doesnt involve constant swearing and sex both do feature in this but in a balanced format iain robertsons camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilarious  as the trailer for the spy who shagged me is pupported to sayif you see one other filmthis spring make it plunkett and macleane its got fun action lurve and of course jonny lee miller with an english accent for a change,1
as many know this is the feature film debut of edward d wood jr as as a writerproducerdirectoractor i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now while i dont like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life everybody knows that he was a transvestite this film is about changing ones sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it however the film still contains woods usual pitfalls of bad dialog meaningless stock footage and hokey special effects throw in woods usual overdose of bela lugosi hamming it up and you have woods first attempt at being a director  the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines the doctor tells him the story of glen who is also a transvestite glen wants to marry barbara but cant bring himself to tell her about his secret he also tells the inspector about alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on lugosis part really isnt well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cash  all in all the movie shows the hallmarks of woods career it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly it definitely has the its so bad its good feel to it however i do have to applaud ed on his progressive thinking in making this film transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on crossdressing,0
soon after this movie was releasedsalman khan was handed over a 6 year imprisonmentread further to know why am i mentioning this  and i heaved a sigh of reliefnot that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant no more salman khan moviesno more his histrionics and no more over hyped actingread overacting  this movie made no sense whatsoever   the scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated according to the movie script it would chase anyonebut ultimately it finds only salman khan bare chested well this is what happened  the rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of 001 to believe that then it chases salman khan who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above unless they are paid to do that  another of breath taking unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and katrina kaif to katrinas father and bingo  everything is fine and govinda marries kartina  this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money  this movie is must avoid and dont even think it had any scene worth watching  the plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishingfor ex choota donwhat a waste of characters  after this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an oskarhahahahwhich means i would never watch,0

i really couldnt get into this movie the plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed she dies and he is left in the basement to starve months must pass and a family moves in the daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father well anyway this guy in the basement who for all rights should be long dead is still around he eats a cat and now is superhuman he now wants to eat people and have sex and when a hooker dies father gets the blame i always dislike movies where someone else is blamed for the killings because you always here the typical lines i didnt do it i could never do such a thing blah blah blah and the family storyline could be a lifetime movie storyline,0
hellraiser bloodline is only a soso film i believe its the fourth installment in the hellraiser series  i missed the beginning and all i remember from there was some topless women and a boxshape thing on a computer screen but using my wit and intelligence and the info button i soon found out that the villain pinhead was released from pandoras box which i believe is a gateway straight to hell  so anyways pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the toymakers family and thats about it oh and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path yawn  what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid and then unleashes the dog on his wife and then kills a random person then he husband comes along blah blah blah who cares why it fails is because hellraiser bloodline is too corny to be scary look at pinheads minion of creatures a cheesy dog that looks like its been turned inside out two men whose heads and bodies are connected together siamese twins in a horror film and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort i havent seen the previous films now look at the main villain his name is pinhead isnt that the name you call somebody when theyre stupid he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers and he has blue skin i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didnt have such a corny name and a corny speech somewhere in the film two cops approach him and say dont make us put some pain on you pinhead replies pain how dare you use that word i am pain blah blah blah blah blah it sounds a bit clich if you ask me  dont forget the final half of the movie the characters and audience get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum some person who we dont recognize maybe he was in the previous films i dont remember him in the beginning of the movie this scene is basically one thing played over and over again   a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise  some other guard oh no hes down i will go check on himby myself  after he dies the same thing happens again  spoilers heres the thing i didnt get in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end so how does he come back for another four films are they prequels why hasnt he died in the previous ones geez the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series end of spoilers hellraiser bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes but has little thrill or scare value just forget it bad special effects with badeverything else make this more of a snoozefest than a good horror  good wellsome people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning plus pinheads voice is pretty cool i suppose if you like ultraviolence you might like this too  bad none of the reasons above make this a very good film the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad and who names their villain pinhead  feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment,0
id have to say that ive seen worse sci fi channel originals but this nu image shonker from yossi wein was still quite a drag the big problem with it is that it simply isnt convincing not just its creature but acting writing and any attempts at drama the direction lacks any kind of flair and the script from boaz davidson and danny lerner never really works predictable often laughable whilst it delivers less howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films it never offers anything to engage or raise the pulse the actors do their best but with such material their workmanlike efforts have little effect matthew reilly burke is a blandly watchable hero meredith morton similar as a blandly watchable love interest actually she was a bit less convincing but at least she was easy on the eyes the film at least has the dignity to bowl along at a reasonable pace but its biggest plus is that the octopus isnt entirely cgi rendered so even though it doesnt look good at least there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in pretty amusing fashion i also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles the scenes of the creature attacking people get old pretty swiftly but there are a few funny scenes where it takes on other things like a boat and a crane yes these scenes are poor but they did make me chuckle undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a new york landmark the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired and well worth looking up on youtube apart from that things are uninspired all round a pg level lack of gore or nastiness stops this one from even pulling off much in the trash good times the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end but i cant really give it credit because the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the stallone flick daylight which by my recollection is quite good altogether this was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something id really recommend to anyone except creature feature die hards better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick but not by much,0
clouzot followed le corbeau where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected with another masterpiece quai des orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset or think we do whodunnit topbilled louis jouvet doesnt appear for forty minutes by which time clouzot has established a rich milieu of music hall music publishers etc and a fine cast of colourful characters angela lansbury lookalike lansbury appeared in woman of paris that same year suzy delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husbandaccompanist bernard blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead from here things go seriously wrong his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his prearranged alibi is out the window whilst meanwhile unknown to him his wife confesses to the murder to the photographer neighbour a closet lesbian in love with her who volunteers to return to the crime scene and retrieve delairs scarf and as long as shes therethoughtfully wipes her prints of the murder weapon a champagne bottle at this point investigator jouvet gets involved and from then on its a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air clouzots output was relatively small but virtually all of it was as spencer tracey said in another context cherce with le salaire de peur and les diaboliques still to come in short this is a must for french cinema buffs,1
this the the final feature film that michelangelo antonioni directed with the help of wim wenders and adapts from his short story collection that bowling alley on the tiber beyond the clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that weve come to be accustomed to from his earlier works and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via wenders directed scenes involving john malkovichs the director character however most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that were used to from an antonioni movie while malkovichs narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place  nonetheless all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight perhaps due to the lack of time since theyre short stories anyway to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship  the first story story of a love affair that never existed tells the romance between silvano kim rossi stuart and carmen ines sastre who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel and later meet at a cafe its as if fate is playing games on them when they meet but part and meet again much later but like the games people play its almost like a lavventura or a la notte with the lack of communication and of the expectations from the man  john malkovichs director character takes central role in the next short who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop played by sophie marceau she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him and in what i thought was to scare him off tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics  the next short dont look for me is the longest of the lot with peter weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress chiara caselli or his wife played by fanny ardant perhaps the more star studded of the lot with jean reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists but unfortunately renos involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements there was a key element adapted from leclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting if theres a negative theme here this short wants to play upon itll be the duplicity of man  in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la notte marcello mastroianni and jeanne moreau where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert finally we have the final shot this body of dirt with vincent perez as a young man going after a girl irene jacob whom he just met and falling in love with her only to realize that it is a love that is too late its a relatively talkie piece just like the first story with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city theyre in which sort of brings to mind richard linklaters before sunrise  while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the excuse to link them up was a film directors exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film,1
you have to like baseball and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded  to japan as his career winds down really well thought out and fascinating look at japanese customs and behavior great supporting performances by sellecks manager japans clint eastwood his girl friend takanashi and his interpreter the chemistry between selleck and takanashi works very very well this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball look for haysbert as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill for allstate movie wraps up very nicely easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball,1
rocketship xm should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons  1 it is one the first  and the few  movies not to have a happy ending doubtless the effect was more profound in postworld war ii america than it would be today but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the films message  2 it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion using space as a valid setting for drama the lack of scientific background notwithstanding the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare its not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space  3 the antinuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers men or animal the effect of martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending  sterno says take a ride on rocketship xm,0
i own a video store with hundreds of documentaries i have seen loads of them and love all of the great info out there only a small handful though even come close to offering info as important as this one i have been reading through other peoples reviews of this film and cant help but notice that the main things people are criticizing are irrelevant such as it is very one sided such a pathetic criticism every where in society that you look you will see the other side and if you still need help go to globalpublicmediacom it is the same people over and over uh one might be led to believe that these people are the experts so maybe they are the best people to interview filming style is all the same head shots with few exceptions if you want flash and dazzle watch micheal moore if you want info watch real docs such as this one as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained my guess is that these people are just missing the point and dont wanna give up there suvs  my recommendation watch it learn from it and continue your education about such subjects it is very important stuff for everyone,1
who won the best actress oscar for 1933 it should have been laura hope crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever she truly is one of the great character actresses of all time she played the frivolous prudence duvernoy in camille 1936 and her best remembered role is aunt pittypat in gone with the wind  irene dunne was the official star of the film but her scenes with laura hope crewes were dynamite  david joel mccrea is in heidelberg when he is offered a job in new york his wife christine irene dunne can continue her studies at the rockafellar centre their first stop in america is a visit to davids mother mrs phelps to say that laura hope crewes dominates every scene is an understatement from her first entrance  in a frantic burst of effort to greet her big boy  all attention is on her even sitting around the tea table when she forgets hesters existence even forgetting how she takes her tea you know something is not quite righthester has been living there for a while  frances dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable hester her performance in this film especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how underrated as an actress she was  all the young cast are excellent eric linden is superb as robert the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mothers spell joel mccrea at one point says painting roses on bathtubs  thats more your style there is a very subtle suggestion in the film of roberts sexuality  irene dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried,1
i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances  films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the films most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job  responsibilityto save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowingi havent seen such angry seas since the perfect storm costar clancy brown hbos carnivale  great to see him again played the captain of the coast guards kodiak alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins the film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience applauding at the end,1
this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it and its decidedly aboveaverage for its genre it was nicely drawn too with some great angles good detail andwell lots of interesting sights  what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat with two guys on it incidentally why were the japs always pictured with big round glasses and bucked teeth   anyway these harmlesslooking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty oh boy thinks the gullible popeye wait until the admiral sees this in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyerand popeye is in deepum water why you doublecrossing japansies yells our sailor man  how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch,1
this film was filled with great acting great musical sounds that blow your mind completely away larenz tatedarius lovehallwaist deep06 was a sharp cat with the gals and he soon met his waterloo with nia longnina mosleybig mommas house2000 nina put her heart and soul into this role and when she meets up with darius the sparks fly at first and then there is a sort of hate relationship the entire cast of actors made this a very entertaining film with plenty of comedy drama and lots of loving and cheating going on this is a very down to earth film and at the same time shows how everyone eventually has his and her destiny in life and are placed in their little corner of this big world great film enjoy,1
this is by far the most pathetic movie indian cinema or any cinema has come up withit is totally a piece of crapthe story line odes not hold any water it is shameful that such a respectful actor has stooped to such a low on making such a disgraceful movie the little respect he had is lost forever he should have retired longtime ago instead of making a fool of himself and loosing all the self respect i would not recommend this movie to any one furthermore i would suggest that amitabh should retire already i wonder how imdb has given some recommendations to this movie there are no movies so horrible that any recommendations could be made seeing such movies as devdas in the same line as this movie does a grave injustice to a decent movie its overall i could say shameless,0

thank god for dvr and the high speed of its fast forward even with that i couldnt sit through any more of that travesty when they came across the old indian asking for beans i gave up and erased it is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights how about some old classics instead the idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods what more can i say it was so awful that i dont think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it but it looks like one more line will do it save your time let alone your money on this dog of a film,0
what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them bugs themhaunts them billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition he paints the good and the bad in all of us he also paints with love i cant imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it they will last because they are true i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed now im an old man and i still feel the tears welling but dont leave the room i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them billy preserved them in this film and not in a greatest generation way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit,1
it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie after all its all about the impact of war on civilians and its by the king of depression ingmar bergman in other words so many of bergmans works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director  even though it is more difficult to watch the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity thats because initially the main characters liv ullman and max von sydow try to overcome adversity and are basically decent though a bit stupid people however as deprivation after deprivation occurs they especially von sydow become less and less humane and more animalisticdoing anything in order to survive  fun to watch no freaking way but an interesting insight into human nature  ps1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine they finished the wine completely in most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched it drives me crazy as i would never leave a 4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it bravo,1
simply put paul bettany and jennifer connelly were remarkable the movie is less about the raw science of darwins beliefs and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family primarily his wife emma and daughter annie  toby jones gives a wonderful turn as thomas huxley the great defender of darwins beliefs and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with bettany and connelly  but it is those two who carry the movie their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end but develops transcendence as darwin grapples with his demons the scene where darwin relates the ending of the story of jenny the orangutan to his dying daughter annie is utterly gripping the world premiere audience at the tiff was spellbound bettanys performance will be recognized as one of the years best in short order equally magnificent is connellys work playing the religious wife of a man who in huxleys words killed god  the film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of darwins grief relishing every detail of bettany and connellys acting  brilliant,1

044 the big trail 1930  released 10241930 viewed 4506  births richard harris harold pinter robert atkins  doug in hollywood raoul walsh unveiled his latest film the big trail a western about the trek west across the frontier starring upandcoming 23yearold actor john wayne in 1930 we are seeing many firsts but few bests besides the first john wayne film we have here the first widescreen film although we only watched the fullframe version interestingly the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later to compete with television which hadnt yet appeared commercially but was still an emerging curiosity all the same this film was extremely good giving us a harrowing look at the trek to oklahoma the opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind about america about the land who should live on it etc and is an excellent demonstration of that walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the wagon company out in the wilderness when they reach a cliff they must rope each wagon down one by one and we also get a revenge subplot involving wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends i seem to recall something similar in stagecoach waynes tough cowboy routine is at least partly there and would surely evolve further in subsequent films since this film is representing all of waynes early 30s work for the odyssey we will not see his face again until stagecoach but once we do we will keep seeing him to the end of the odyssey and beyond  kevin ah our first sound western and john waynes first starring role its raoul walshs the big trail this review will be short since its been weeks since i watched it i enjoyed this movie but it was far from a masterpiece the mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises like when the brains of the bad guys red flack tyrone power sr in his last role is killed half way through i thought he would be the boss at the end but that ended up being bill thorpe ian keith i remember that i didnt like the way breck wayne kills thorpe and exacts revenge at the end i understood that thats what he was meant to do in the story but i really didnt like his reasoning when he tells ruth why he has to do it i think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was leading through the harsh west  last film viewed animal crackers 1930 last film chronologically soup to nuts 1930 next film lage dor 1930,1
i had this movie given to me and have to admit i am glad that i did not pay money for it  the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle with 2 women trying to seduce her but the reality in this movie is far from that  in reality the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all  even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things which the box tries to compare this movie to were riveting because of the unexpected turns and suspense  but jaded has none of this it concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them and the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true  while it does show that same sex rape is possible it is not a movie worth watching  if at all possible pass this movie up at all costs,0

not having any idea what this film was about but based on the fact that john leguizamo was appearing in it we decided to watch it well it turned out not to be the wisest decision in fact as another commentary in this forum puts it we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie  while the film is by no means horrible it doesnt make sense at all the over the top performance by william baldwin doesnt help the situation either john leguizamo is a multitalented actor who deserved better the basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way the result is an uneven film,0
this was a very good ppv but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later the wwe crammed so many matches on it some of the matches were useless im not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do  however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan  some matches were a complete waste of time like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short  mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake the snake roberts were very good indeed  overall grade  b,1
an off beat but very delightful performance by john travolta sets off this very funny comedy his interpretation of the archangel is as a scuffy womanizing overweight ladies man and he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to chicago john hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for chicago tabloid owner bob hoskins angie macdowell plays role much as she did her role in four weddings and a funeral maureen stapleton is neat in a cameo her comment michael doesnt suffer fools is just one of many memorable moments bob hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect a little to off the wall mainly youre there to see michael take on a bull mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing,1
spoiler  this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending i hated this film  mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons politically this film glorified war and military technology  blowing things up real good we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the ruskies to bits and no us soldiers put their lives on the line  so its a fun war aesthetically there isnt a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences and speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to i had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 911  with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong but that wouldnt leave the audience feeling good this is a feel good movie about killing ruskies and it made me sick,0
a sprawling overambitious plotless comedy that has no dramatic center it was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair at least in some episodes but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole and the laughs are few and far between amusing ending though 12,0
this woman is a terrible comedian she cant crack a joke she has no real character this is another example of typical american rubbish that people laugh at because they have no idea how to react so they say to themselves well its a comedy show so ill laugh i guess  i cannot stand this miserable woman and her pi poor excuse for comedy she does not deserve anything but booing  why cant america dump this kind of turdish delight and go for something that actually contains humour  she is not funny not at all why oh why does even one person like this idiot,0
it takes an eternity for this typically oversimplistic and idiotic stephen kingbased film to finally get out of the starting blocks about halfanhour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas but this is supposed to be the horror genre or so i naively thought the mutt fails to look all that fearsome which leonard maltin the notoriously cluelesshopeless and always grinning film critic would disagree with he considers cujo to be genuinely frightening i often do have to wonder if maltin is genuinely thick  or merely likes to do favors for his hollywood friends its both illogical and inconsistent the way wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury and naturally her car breaks down just when she needs it to save her life this is one of the oldest horrorfilm clichs trust king to use it to minimum effect the premise is imbecilic too banal even for a horror film a rabid mutt attacks a family is that it this sort of thing barely constitutes a 3minute subsubplot in your average zombie film i think even cujo must have sensed that he was starring in a turkey mutts have terrible agents but what i really dont understand is how people can actually throw themselves at the cujo book and read it from cover to cover these sk fans must be immortal thats the only explanation ie why they treat time as such a meaningless commodity  bodycount 3,0
although many have mixed feelings about this latter day giallo thriller from argento it still stands as another lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance that is argento  a young opera singer has her first break out performance and suddenly finds herself the subject of obsession for a crazed maniac  in a way opera is like a modernday giallo take on phantom of the opera blended with all the glorious style and color that one would expect dario argento to deliver argento makes terrific use of inventive camera techniques reoccurring symbols like those ravens gothic atmosphere and truly gruesome murder sequences one scene especially which involves a peep hole and a gun will knock viewers right out of their seats storywise the film also manages to be gripping with some strong suspense and given great atmosphere by claudio simonettis gorgeous music score  the cast does some satisfying performances cristina marsillach is good as our leading lady the late ian charleson does a nice turn as the director as does urbano barberini as an investigator daria nicolodi as marsillachs agent and william mcnamara as marsillachs illfated lover   opera is terrific latter day argento and perhaps the last of his great works its sure to please his fans and even create some new ones   out of,1
i saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the dpp video nasty list and while im glad i saw it because its now another video nasty down  on its own merits andy milligans film really isnt worth bothering with there are of course far worse films on the infamous list but that doesnt make the pain of viewing this one any easier the film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget and that has translated into the script as blood rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema and doesnt do anything new with it basically the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will its not long before they start getting picked offblah blah blah for most of the film nothing happens and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned theyre so amateurish and silly that theyre impossible to take seriously on any level its a very good thing that this movie doesnt have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture it all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending which also succeeds in being a nonevent of epic proportions apparently this movie is still banned here in the uk but somehow i doubt its because of its shock value basically blood rites isnt worth seeing and i personally can see no reason to recommend it unless of course youve made it your business to see everything on the video nasty list,0
what a script what a story what a mess,0
this is a hard movie to come by in the us but if you can find it  and youre interested in the life and music of percy aldridge grainger youre in for a treat its quite historically accurate richard roxboroughs grainger looks astoundingly like grainger at this period in time emily woofs karen holten is quite a bit prettier than the real karen but that was an inaccuracy i was happy to discover  i think what really struck me though was how well roxborough captured graingers outrageous personality barbara hersheys rose was also a treasure if she looks considerably younger than rose did at that period it is more than made up for in how well she captured roses obsession with percy its an easy film to recommend i should note that when she saw passion my wife had no particular affinity for or knowledge of grainger and his music but she was totally captivated by the film,1
jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease making most of his peers green with envy while his performance in save the tiger is oscarworthy i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other better roles that had preceded this current one  this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast or in this case one particular member its too bad the screenwriters output didnt match that of lemmons dont waste your time with this one,0
dont be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds mon oncle antoine because like the best of canadian films darkness lurks just below the surface   set presumably in 1940s rural quebec the story explores the developing consciousness of young benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death   the look of the film is astonishing especially seeing as a high proportion of criticism towards canadian cinema by the general public surrounds aesthetics beyond this the unassuming benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience looking at his corrupting community with fresh an innocent eyes   i recommend reading jim leachs critical essay on the film in canadas best features for anyone looking to place the film into a historical context while also dissecting the form of the film definitely check this one out,1
ive read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark ive noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film de niro is in no way murphys buddy throughout most of this movie in fact part of the comedy of this film is de niros reluctance to be friends with anybody  murphy really shines in this one he is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice rene russo is also great as the tv producer of course she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard along with murhpy to get deniro going too  a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner reprising his role as tj hooker to train murhpy  de niro how to act like cops but my favorite scene involves murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a wesly snipeslike cop to team up with instead of de niro man that was hilarious comedies often depend on your personal tastes sure you could poke holes in the plot most often you can with a comedy i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niroi think it brought out the best in murphy which was nice to see him at the top of his game again i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro rating 8 of 10 stars,1
i loved this movie its a lot of laughs the acting is good and the writing is really sharp id rather see a hundred movies like this than three lord of the rings repeating and repeating themselves  its a low budget affair and seems to be shot on dv but looks good and jay mohr and julianne nicholson are great together why do you have a ten line minimum im not a critic just a patron  i doubt very much that quentin tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence this movie should be seen on more screens than just one i laughed from beginning to end,1
mild spoilers   the premise goes like this  a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees   so far so good  but theres a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25000 dollars but why  come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail  a very real possibilty for arson  for the sake of 25 grand  i know i wouldnt  and seeing as youd have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is 25000 dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques  theres also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise  since mister lumpke has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much  wouldnt alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something    i guess were not suppossed to think about such details since a pyromaniacs love story isnt suppossed to be an intelligent thriller  its a light hearted romantic comedy chick flick thats probably best apprieciated as a girls night in  looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasnt too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top,0
i for one was very anxious to watch this movie  though i knew it was going to be another type of movie in the style of revenge of the nerds i was still impressed  there is plenty of truth to the fact of this type of learning and believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a new style of schooling  conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know  this approach to teaching should be further sought out in true academic courses  while there still was too much of the partying scenes it obviously had to be thrown in there  for hollywoods sake of making a comedy about collegeeven though we all know that life isnt really like that by any means  a touch unbelievable still funny and with a killer ending  awesome ending crucial to the entire story and very surprising  without the final scene the movie would have been half as good  i liked this movie and it didnt have to have overly amounts of swearing or nudity or gross out jokes for it to be good  great crew and cast story and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory hampton frat members was well done  american pie 1 2 3 and american wedding or whatever clones it makes doers not measure up to this by 13  far better than most comedies about first year college with no demeaning stupid jokes to make somebody throw up with  i liked it even though it was simpleit was interesting and even had heartmy only regret for watching this movie is that it wasnt longer,1
i absolutely love this movie i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday this movie brings up several questions one is who are the monsters of this world to be different is just that different the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness they are those that everyone considers a nice quiet bloke who didnt bother anybody or they are worse they are the characters such as played by croneberg men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood i love the shapeshifters people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon this movie touches on and explores what is normal who are other and what fear does to some even though i gave this movie 10 i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median my other complaint was why didnt they ever make a second film i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end,1
i think homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie  more like plantation grown  but it doesnt have quite the same ring to it my guide described it a comedy but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh more in the genre of the farcical thrillerdrama the characters developed well enough  an allstar cast made it ohso promising just a shame the plot was patently absurd ted danson provided a fine cameo as did jamie lee curtis in her walkon part jon bon jovi has this amazing ability to measure thc content in the front seat of his car i guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one  not for the gun shy paranoid types though,0
ive been studying brazilian cinema since 2004 when i stumbled onto cidade de deus  city of god let me tell you something this movie is probably as good or better than city of god  the acting cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience i have not been to brazil yet but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of so paulo  i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it  something you want to watch but nothing you want to go to sleep on,1
this is not a film to impress you with high budget hightech shots fast camera movements or glimmering costumes thought by an overzealous and hungry director but its a film by a director who is also a very good photographer who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human not as an halfgod unlike most of the directors this is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best performances with unreal or at best learned gestures and mimics rather its a film in which they act as real as it can be actually they are not professional actors at all the dialogues between the main characters their expressions their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life you tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words you show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted guest this is the same feeling of disconnection that you get in modern city life and this is your chance to see yourself from outside impersonated by the main characters i saw all of the films of nuri bilge ceylan incl his short film koza cacoon thanks to those who puts it in the dvd many would compare him with tarkovsky ozu and maybe bresson or bergman as he is emerging as a true auteur and he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life that is the kind of sincerity youll find in uzak,1
i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse drivein cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets i am growing to love many of crown internationals movies  especially the creepy erotic psychological thrillers   death machines is not one of them  after seeing movies like malibu beach the creeping terror and the pink angels it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made but it doesnt have much going for it  no plot really no story to speak of  the acting isnt evident  only the actor responsible for the terriblyplayed tony with the thick fake italian accent made any attempt to get into character   the score is annoying and pedantic  the only thing about this movie is why what compelled the filmmakers to make this film   did they think the story of 1 three ninjas 2 two competing crime bosses 3 an ancillary bartender  karate school student character and 4 his pitiful loveinterest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made   this is a complete waste of time and money for you me the producers writers actors and the director,0
first i would like to apologize for my rating of 1 the only reason i give this film such a high rating is that i cant delve into negative integers all this is a spoof musings aside and while i certainly have tried to give it due consideration have left me with a certain notion namely this is quite possibly the worst film ever made on any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement seriously i tried im just as in to any indie bornforcultvideodistribution film as the next buff but seriously this movie sucked rhino balls  honestly if i had directed this film i would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide,0
crossfire is ostensibly a murder mystery but what distinguishes it from other similar movies of the period is the killers motive which is antisemitism the story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance which fuels bigotry and contains references to a hillbilly and an irish immigrant who also suffered maltreatment because of their ethnicity  the movies plot is based on richard brooks novel called the brick foxhole which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay its ironic that this story about a form of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censors who stipulated that for the screen version the type of bigotry involved should be changed to antisemitism another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems fiercely proud of having served in a war against the nazis and yet embraces their hatred of jews the director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the house unamerican activities committee all these points just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this movie  when police captain finlay robert young investigates the murder of joseph samuels sam levene he discovers that on the night when he was killed samuels had been socialising with a group of soldiers and one of these corporal arthur mitch mitchell george cooper is quickly identified as the prime suspect further information is also gathered from montgomery robert ryan who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and sergeant keeley robert mitchum whos a friend of mitchell keeley with the help of some other soldiers then searches for mitchell and when he finds him hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called ginny tremaine gloria grahame  keeley helps michell to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer ginny tremaine is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove mitchells innocence but finlays investigations lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real culprit into exposing his own guilt  crossfire is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story the message is conveyed in a way which was no doubt appropriate for the period in which it was made but by todays standards seems rather heavy handed the cinematography by j roy hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen  despite it being a low budget production crossfire was a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast two of whom were nominated for academy awards for best supporting actor robert ryan and best supporting actress gloria grahame the additional nominations for edward dmytryk best director producer adrian scott best picture and john paxton best writing adapted screenplay are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received,1
tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his oldlady owner in the same baggage car also in a cage is sylvester   in no time sylvester has grabbed tweety but a trainman comes back and slaps the sneakin feline as he calls him back in his cage he puts tweety in a safer place up high and tells the cat now remember no tricks sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent yeah right  i found the funniest stuff however didnt involve sylvester versus tweety but the viscious dog that is in another cage next to sylvester the cat gets mouthy with him and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner sylvester just doesnt learn but thats one reason we love him i know a number of imdb reviewers dont like tweety but i like both main characters  they both crack me up  also the train and the passing scenery is beautifully illustrated in here  really nice visuals,1
this has got to be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever witnessedit is simply not funny and the scriptwriters have obviously just tried to use the name of the tv series in order to make a few quid at the box office this film makes a carry on seem subtle as far as sexual innuendo goes  no mean feat and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis a complete washout im afraid,0
northfork is what is wrong with indie films for all of their hardedged commentary and attacking big subjects studios wont this is the sacrifice we make for nearly two hours i was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies  there are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy two men dressed in black one of them james woods must coerce the remaining inhabitants of northfork to leave before a dam opens up and floods the town the other story has a boy returned to the priest nick nolte that gave him to the parents he is dying and is visited i guess by angels among them anthony edwards with bizarre spectacles and daryl hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from seinfeld  though this is the plot it is not what the film is about the film is about nothing it does nothing says nothing goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show perhaps by design more likely an aftereffect of the pretentious surreal david lynch wannabe  were an important artsy film cant you see  style of direction the entire movie is filtered through a gray bleak backdrop that i suppose fits a film about death instead it simply makes the film that much harder to watch  if you want to see a film about men in black see either men in black films neither too impressive but compared to northfork they are lifted to citizen kane status if you want to see a film about a boy dying watch lorenzos oil if you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch o brother where art thou if you want to watch a film better than northfork there are hundreds if you want to watch a film that is worse there are only a handful 0 out of,0
the acrobatics mixed with haunting music make one spectacular show the costumes are vibrant and the performances will just boggle your mind simply amazing,1
this is really bad the characters were bland the story was boring and there is no sex scene furthermore it lacks drama the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced nothing happens in this film you would expect a sex scene but they just have a kiss the plot revolves around three characters a man his wife and a stranger that they pick up from the high way the couple invite the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right no they just kiss and thats it also this film contains no action no comedy no drama and not even suspense makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script,0
have wanted to see this for a while i never thought id be watching it in a damp trafalgar square london with 15000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys  quickly that experience specifically a new departure from psb it seemed to suffer from the same problem the miniaturist hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor the long structure was a chain of short ones ie songs psb produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was id go so far to say counterproductive overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve  it is a very exciting film with choppier editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and theres a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time  super film which can be assessed irrespective of sound as thats how the finished product would have been conceived 810,1
this 25 hour diluted snorefest appears to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation ever clearly possessing a budget allowing for breathtaking location shooting in greece the monies might have been better spent working out a cohesive script with character development and motivations clearly outlined especially since bill has gone through the trouble of doing this already the portrayals lacked passion  direction leaving the viewer debating whether they should bother to care about the demise of the protagonists at all which brings out another pointthe main character of the original work prospero is not so named in this rendition despite the fact that most other characters names are used enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece in fact all aspects that made the stage version of the tempest full of wonder and intrigue have been sucked completely from this convoluted version about a selfabsorbed pompous arse who cant figure out how to care about anything beyond the blur of his wealth and power over all a lackluster effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration,0
fast times it aint but check this movie out it has a heart pour yourself a drink and enjoy its loaded with a slew of justbeginning stars sherilyn fenn has her first onscreen credited cameo chris penn lea thompson eric stotz jenny wright rick moranis etcthey all look so young oh and if you look closely the cops wife is nancy wilson from the rock band heart,1
being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie clubthis also includes apeschimps and orangutans i am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best cause mischief shenanigans hyjinx solve human problems and teach us about ourselves  the story is simple enough in short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants luckily theres a few monkeyschimpanzees that have a bounty on their head that would get boba fett or dogsduane chapman blood flowing as the boy tries to catch the monkeys he learns about himself his family his grandpa the local weirdo flirts with a girl twice his age and learns the beast way to deal with bullies is to have someone point a shotgun at them  there within lies the problem so much focus is put on the boy that the chimps just dont get the screen time they deserve the chimps are not as talented as the chimps that play jack from the mp trilogy or the legendary orangutans that play dunstin or clyde1 or 2 so dont watch this movie expecting to find the next big thing in the chimp genre the chimps hit some sweet flips which is what the film needed more of there is an epic scene of the chimps breaking into the poor families house and destroys all the things they worked so hard for serious monkey movie enthusiasts will want to rent the film for this scene alone  so in closing this movie is not for the serious monkey movie enthusiast i wouldnt recommend this movie to families as it encourages a childs rebellion against their parents i can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well supervised children,0
do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine kind of east german version of buffalo soldiers  nva works on a metalevel that it sympathizes with its heroes attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can its not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles utopian of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtful  just to fill the required 10 lines do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job,1
wasted is just that a waste of time mtv is churning out made for tv movies at quite a clip nowadays a friend of mine recommended this and i rented it needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore recomendations from her anytime soon this movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use the problem is you really dont care about any of the characters due to lack of believabilty and their own self discipline this movie is in a word annoying to watch from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing the digital format tries for realism but comes up distracting if you want a true scope on drug use watch requiem for a dream,0
in the beginning with the careful remote location and sweeking metal sound i thought of the opening scene in once upon a time in the west when it gets to the city then it begins to feels like kitchen stories or drifting clouds even possibly grimm  then it turns out that this is more similar to joe versus the volcano in theme not style and the movie executes from beginning to end the same understated style letting you observe take in the steel bluegrayish tone of the suites dresses wall color furniture bedsheets mirrors cars music background sounds and even peoples expression then near the end there is one shot of a completely different tone  warm orangeishyellow with soft music and ocean splashing children and laughter  but maybe the observation is too long for me i would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot still beautifully done,1
a must for any die hard carpenters fans  cynthia gibb does the role of kc a huuuuuge amount of justice and although the story isnt 100 factual is still a good insight into the lives of both richard and karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack  makes me cry everytime,1
the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece the first sequel jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though its still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style director shunya ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still hes managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it again the action focuses on nami matsushima aka scorpion and this time shes out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back after escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother the prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother  while scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison but scorpion doesnt like spending time behind bars and its not long before shes back to doing what she does best  the film gets off to a great start as we see scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail from there however the film slows down a lot and beast stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films thats not to say that there isnt still plenty of action  scorpion still spends a lot of time in revenge mode and the film isnt exactly short on general sleaze meiko kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and its another understated almost wordless performance her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge there are more people who have angered scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film theres a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point overall i would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality  not as great as the original and slightly better than the second,1
looking back on the year 2006one of the things i will remember most is the snakeamania on the internet for a film called snakes on a planebut unknown to me there was a straight to dvd ripoff film called snakes on a trainafter seeing this i feel its at best a belowpar bmovie  the plot  a husband and wife get on a train to go to los anglesto get help form the husbands uncle who is a shamanthis is because the wifes family do not approve of her marring himso they have put a curse on her that snakes will become herthought with a sixteen hour drive to los angles and a group of passengers the include an exnarc cop and some drug traffickerswill they get there in time before the snakes take her over   view on the film first the effectsi have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gorywaythe main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to seeare sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the filmthe film makes 198os video games look like t2 next to thisone of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film and the directors make the film so anticlimatic it ruins the whole film final view on the film  a belowpar bmoviewith an unbelievably bad ending,0
i watch this movie without big expectations i think everyone should do its a great tvserie and of course we couldnt compare it with gone with the wind but its still nice to watch its also weird to see a different scarlett joanne whalley dont play scarlett with passion and fire like vivien leigh but i believe that scarlett is changed when she became older dont expect to much of this just watch but dont watch like i think this would be horrible,1
the regard of flight written and performed by bill irwin is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen full of quick and sparkling dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade it is head and shoulders above 99 of comedy as it is presented today i am sure it will one day take its rightful place with such great shows as the fantastiks and waiting for godot why it isnt available on dvd yet is a mystery and a tragedy,1
cary elwes have to say puts on a better performance then costner did in rhpot but anyhow  have to say this film it just makes me laugh so much mainly because the actors seem really into what their doing and you just sit there and thinking what the hell are they on but in a very very very very good waythe random outbursts of songs were brilliant and well and the musical score used i really really likedgreat casting and as said before everyone seemed so into their roles  1010 from me defiantly  because unlike some other robin hoodsi can speak with an english accent,1
this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly each of the three teenage girls offer their own believable distinct assertive and entertaining personalities i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa if one looked beyond the superficial action that was taking place keiths character treated lisas deflowering with tenderness and consideration the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle dialogue was sharp quick and flowed nicely the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled although the movie appears light on the surface it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult human emotions and desire,1
i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later i still think traffik is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama  it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the 80s and unless they change their policies will be so in another 20 years  well written well made beautifully acted and superbly filmed a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade,1
symbolism galore great tunes this film crushed their soon to be no more target audiences expectations these monkees and the naturally selected members of the group were witnessing a subtle yet in your face kiss goodbye to each other the message rings true today the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of are the next generations own disappointments there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains the film can be frustrating at times because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the american way of life a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of head and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday american life but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness the final scene similar to don quixotes chivalric daring of the caged tiger to exit for battle represents just how delusional and impossible most dreams are,1
its another variation on the ofttold tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris from television and it shows because its the kind of tale that plays like a halfhour situation comedy padded out to feature film lengthbut with a scarcity of laughs or to put it differently only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the halfhour limits of a tv show  doris day decided to call it quits after this filmand its rather easy to see why even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesnt help brian keith barbara hershey pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen  nothing much can be said in favor of it skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films,0
so youre a giant mantis and youve been hanging out in the arctic for a while and youre tired of eskimos hitting you with snowballs whats a giant mutant insect to do head for the big city of course see the sights maybe catch a show on broadway but wait just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own some pesky humans start attacking you argh time to smash  anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies because it has pretty decent fx for 1957 but thats about it avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things or see another perry mason actor in a b movie  410,0
director nico mastorakis has made a cynical cashgrabber by his own admission that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan  the most extreme confronting genre pics to paraphrase a character in videodrome have a philosophy that is what makes them dangerous  island of deaths philosophy is to throw many shocking elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly the result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance  not to be confused with serradors brilliant who could kill a child sometimes called island of death mastorakiss effort is set on a greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion  everything moves at a snailish pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed  touted as the movie that the censors didnt want you to see id hazard a guess that the censors never saw it they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked upwards,0
i watched this movie last night im a huge fan of the book and i was pretty happy with the version in which winona ryder and susan sarandon starred but this one its just awful oh my god i dont understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister and making amy the 3rd one and jo interpretation terrible jo was a feminist intelligent and kinda angry young lady and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl and whats with the laurie going to war im ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made but not rewrite the whole story very very bad done,0
i first saw this film as a teenager im now in my 40s and have long considered it to be my favorite movie the story is enormously moving without being sentimental the acting especially by march and loy is deadon and the fact that dana andrews is too old for his role doesnt take away from the believability of his romance with theresa wright whom i believe is the only major character in the film still living this could have turned out to be another postwar melodrama but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen,1
to view the fictionalized biography the phenix city story i claim is to enter fields where us filmmakers have seldom ventured director phil karlson got his directorial assignment on the untouchables tv megahit series largely on the basis of kansas city confidential and this film and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated movies ever made the rarest feat for us filmmakers seems to be the herocentered purposeful anticrime film or tv series i remind the viewer how mightily cains hundreds and hardcastle and mccormicks and even the untouchables producers had to work to produce anything but episodes devoted largely to the unfictional activities of criminals rather than those of their ethical opponents this powerful seminal and verygritty movie has a style all its own and its lesson seems to be attention to detail about the opponents and victims of criminal organizations as well as their gang members there is a twelveminute prelude to the film in which reporter clete roberts interviews the real participants from the alabama citys who had struggled against its corrupt vice gangs the problem grew out of the presence of fort benning across the river and the nearly centurylong existence of vice dens in the area the film details the return of john patterson from germany where he has been a prosecutor his father defeated for attorney general of alabama refuses to join his pursuit of the 14th street vicelords despite several provocations including a beating of his son avenged by patterson on his tormentor there are several welldeveloped characters including ellie who works in one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend the leader of the syndicate the pattersons and johns wife ed gage the vicelords operatives and zeke ward an honest black man victimized for his opposition to them the cinematography by harry neumann and the art direction by stanley fleischer are in bw and are very much like newsfilm adding to the films realistic power music by harry sukman contributes to the film effectively writer daniel mainwaring and crane wilbur produced a swiftpaced and straightforward story that divides into parts part one illustrates the vicelords empire from inside one of their clubs showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then picked up by police in the pay of the mob in part two albert patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the mob the intelligent rhett tanner in part three young patterson returns and after several incidents including his having to beat up the mobs head goon to avenge his own beating decides to run his father for attorney general of the state his wife is horrified and the mob kills zeke wards daughter and dumps the body at pattersons house with a warning his children will be next a few more such incidents including the loss of a trial in which the pattersons prove the goon killed a friend of theirs who had found the car implicated in the murder of the little girl and watch the inquest declare the death accidental convince patterson to run and he wins the democratic statewide nomination despite the mobs statist tacticsand is promptly assassinated john patterson stops a vigilante crowd from starting open warfare with the 14th street mob and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for phenix city the clubs are closed and equipment confiscated but not before the girl inside is murdered by the mobs goon and patterson has to be stopped by zeke ward from killing tanner instead of delivering him to the law the dramas ending is upbeat but the prognosis for the town is less sanguine than painted the mob in fact tried to come back then moved to tennessee in this wellacted classic of anticrime filmmaking richard kiley is young but very strong as patterson playing it without an accent john mcintyre as his father is very good while edward andrews as boss tanner is award caliber others in the cast include kathryn grant as the girl inside ellie jean carson and kathy marlowe as the mobs women john larch as their goon biff mcguire as the young victim james edwards as zeke ward lenka peterson as johns wife and some good character actors as townsmen and mob bosses it is i suggest hard to say enough good things about the realism and lack of posturing in this film it is certainly one of phil karlsons best directorial efforts karlson also did the scarface mob later did walking tall as well a sobering and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a publicinterest democracy can acquiesce to tyranny and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights,1
this is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the civil war this film is a must see for eastwood fans and eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did i couldnt agree more watch out this is a spoiler eastwood does die in the end eastwood and director don siegel rightfully argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons they wanted to stick to the book for one secondly there cant always be a happy ending thirdly this was written during the vietnam war they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying i agree with all of this it is a wonderfully shot film and i love most films involving the civil war it is more of a portrait of how deceptive women can be that they can be more dangerous than men hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film beguiled to be deceived the song sung by eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the civil war but the vietnam war and maybe indirectly the women he comes across during the film wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes note this film is rated r for no reason there is hardly any language it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex but there is no nudity really excellent film 910,1
its hard to believe a movie can be this bad but you live and learn whats more amazing is the fact that the people who put this thing together likely had college educations meanwhile the fruit of their labor bares the appearance of something a group of five eighth graders may have come up with on the bright side if there is one the soundtrack has some nice moments which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so hideously bad,0
subtle delicate touching  a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy history of a coming out and anatomy of relationship  soft ambiguous gestures slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression  two men a girl a afternoon on beach some words and a gift religious traces and a pantheist vision cercle of light and expression nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening  a erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives values  pledge for self discover universe of beauty exploration the sign of ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation robe dete is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream to look with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people,1
barbara payton is the supposetobe sultry sexy young hot chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in hollywood raymond burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who mrs payton is desiring to blow the joint with there is another girl some sort of peasant slave thing that burr used to fool around with but hes given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voodoo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the payton tramp i watched this only part way through because its really awful so didnt even get to see the star of the showwhich i guess is a gorilla that the voodoo hag turned someone into or whateverwho cares i give this one half star out of a possible ten its not even campy just really bad,0
i watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved though i felt that the directing was done well the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them its just a little too slow this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better the only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that i downed during the course of the flick bring on the slasher films folks because at least i know what to expect out of them this was not my thing too much dark humour and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens  in conclusion i give this horrorcomedy film a very generous 3 out of 10,0
although many audio recordings of great musicians like jascha heifetz survive the cinematic or televised record is limited indeed this is why musical offerings like they shall have music are such rare gems while with modern eyes and ears one can quibble about the plot the perceptive viewer should put this films unique delights in their proper perspective the plot was designed to appeal to both young and old audiences of the era but it remains enjoyable to this day a important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the moviegoer of that era  i must take issue with reviewer who complains about a film that is in black and white or who feel obliged to report that their students express such reservations these are juvenile complaints which reflect a limited historical perspective for the teacher this should offer up an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in cinematic history color can in fact get in the way of a good storyline or the music for example the black and white photography of john fords stagecoach is like the still photographs of ansel adams an artistic masterpiece  as for heifetz being wooden i could not disagree more if you want blatant emotional posturing go to a rock concert the role of a classical musician like heifetz is to move the audience not him or herself heifetzs emotion is conveyed through his playing not through his body language he had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance out of the music and transfer it to his listeners it is the listener who should be moved not the artist  incidentally one reviewer asked about seeing heifetz on youtube playing the 1st movement of the tchaikovsky violin concerto with frank mchugh in the audience this is from the 1947 film carnegie hall not they shall have music carnegie hall is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime we are blessed that there were film producers who at least in these limited instances chose to showcase these artists in was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common denominator tripe we get today,1
russell t davies has been tasked with recreating a slice of my childhood hiding behind the sofa watching scary monsters battle with dr who he and his crew are clearly all true devotees of the original series  in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene rodenberrys original concept far more believable russell t davies has both money and the advantages of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared  the accompanying series dr who confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again  how does david tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors time will tell but tonight seeing billie piper play alongside elisabeth sladen who was the doctors companion in the 1970s confirm that she has both the acting ability screen presence and script to be the no 1,1
you dont see the meaning of the title till much later but you get the point of it in the first few minutes this directorial debut from golden globe nominated for actor danny devito also playing owenned little ned lift is a terrific hitchcocklike film about one mans hate for his wifes book she stole his and one mans hate for his mother basically owen wants to be a good writer like his teacher larry donner billy crystal and he inspired by murder stories larry suggests he see a hitchcock film quite ironic and that is when owen has the idea to kill larrys exwife margaret star trek voyagers kate mulgrew owen is inspired by strangers on a train swapping murders so larry must kill owens horrible momma oscar and golden globe nominated anne ramsey larry was convinced owen killed margaret and also that he had towanted to kill owens momma but there is a happy ending when months later both larry and owen bring out books momma died naturally and they went on a holiday with beth ryan kim greist also starring rob reiner as joel and oprah winfrey with hilarious moments a great directoractor and his support this is a mustsee comedy very very good,1
after a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr slausen chuck connors owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins once at the creepy roadside attraction the friends are stalked by a maskwearing lunatic who can bring the museums dummies to life through the power of the mind  tourist traps bad guy is a demented cross between the texas chain saw massacres leatherface and anthony the scary kid from the classic twilight zone episode its a good life whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned tcm hitchcocks psycho and house of wax the atmosphere and execution of tourist trap however is so totally offkilter that in this respect its virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies  director david schmoellers continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality and with a brilliant leftfield performance from connors an impossibly creepy score from pino donaggio a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws and the presence of super sexy tanya roberts who spends the film in and briefly out of tiny denim hotpants and a figure hugging boobtube tourist trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately oneofakind horror experience well deserving of its cult following,1
this is one of the best horror  suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decadeseven though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes a lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of farfetchedthe acting was not that greatbut my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of tenif you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for youi have to admitit was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax i myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way,1
apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film i have not seen it since i was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly  the bunyip was terrifying nightmare inducing terrifying with the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo runninghopping away for their lives  as a kid i also remember the animated hobbit no worries watership down didnt blink an eye dot and the kangaroo it still haunts my dreams and i have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy maybe we can get a group rate on therapy  in short one freaky film for its time,0
i remember all the hype around this movie when aaliyah was killed being a fan of ms rices novels my first thought was how can they do queen of the damned without doing vampire lestat first  having finally seen the movie now i can see how they did it if you have read these books imagine taking out the gory parts from vampire lestat cramming marcus and marius into one character and removing everything to do with lestats beginning the wolf hunt his violin playing the theatre of the vampires and also louis claudia and gabrielle then in the last 15 minutes cramming in queen of the damned  what we loose is a very important piece of lestats character his inner agony of having to kill to live the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims and his lovehate relationship with louis armand gabrielle and all the other vampires  also important to the story is that we loose the story of the twins which is the genesis of ms rices vampires and while i am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen they could have done something closer and showed us more of ancient egypt  even worse we have this love interest thrown in between jessie and lestat the vampire chronicles is basically an american yoni story for those that do not know yoni is another form of hentai japanese porn comics but in yoni it is about gay male relationships told by a female while i am sure many men object to the gayness of the characters in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way for instead of lestat persueing killers he goes after young female groupies  and the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast at the beginning lestat emerges from a century long sleep then later on asks marius how he made it through the 1950s in red velvet marius has no idea who elvis is and says he slept through that period makes you wonder how lestat knows about 50s fashion and music since he slept through the same time period himself and nothing is ever even mentioned about louis claudia or gabrielle i think that is a huge shame is like seeing snow white and the 3 dwarfs  overall the movie i thought was really bad about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack most of the acting was poor the accents drove me up the wall and all of the really indepth parts of the book were removed leaving us only with a hollow shell kind of like enkil after he was sucked dry  if you want to see a good modern vampire movie get lost boys the original interview with a vampire or even some old episodes of dark shadows let this one rest in piece with a stake through the heart cloves of garlic around the neck and a vial of holy water in the mouth  in ending remember that before aaliyah was killed this was intended to go straight to video no theatrical release was planned it is obvious now why this was it is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie instead of something where she really might have shined  i rate this a 2 on a scale of 110,0
what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed 16mm stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to revisit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an 88 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s  80s but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the then illegal stag loop,0
omg it is seriously the best show in the world it rocks harder then jackass and cky and is so funny and entertaining i love the show all 5 seasons are awesome but for a quick summary season 1 great if you wanna plan a scavenger hunt watch the house be pulled apart and enjoy seeing phil bing starved  season 2 great if you wanna see them buy castle bam watch a slayer concert see the wonder that is mardi gras and the fun of getting to it see a demo derby and actually see a the making and opening of a tree top casino  season 3 great if you wanna see probably the first driveway skatepark a civil war johnny knoxville a pirate ship and don vito actually winning one of bams reindeer games  season 4 great if you wanna see them in europe them getting jobs the building of a state and a bayou and the dudesons season 5 great if ya want to see them in brazil apes birthday mike vallely the metal mulisha bams lambo disappearing bams hummer being destroyed a playboy party in bams swimming pool and the very last ever viva la bam,1
i cant praise this film enough it had a lot of that handheld firstperson shaking camera which i love and some hate because it makes them sick like rec cloverfield and blair witch project  it is a long movie for its kind but i didnt even notice because the film was so interesting by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporters work the movie keeps up the pace making it a realtime experience for the viewer  while i would never call this film the scariest horror ever made id have to say its certainly one of the best ive seen the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images camera glitches events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations the ending is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards a second viewing is highly recommended though  watch this one alone in the dark dont expect anything and youll have fun,1
i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows from the cheesy mockumentaries like discovery channels the haunting to scooby doo reality shows like ghost hunters when i saw promos for aes paranormal state i knew i was going to watch especially when paranormal state was juxtaposed against a weak monday night football game  by the end of the pilot of paranormal state when the main character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von sydow holy water and reassures him by telling this boy that he too had a unspecified bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the catholic church gave him a holy water to fend off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot  the shtick behind paranormal state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club or society or super adventure club and they run around pennsylvania researching the most terrible hauntings and the lost plot to an m night shymalan movie  the they is kind of a misnomer really paranormal state revolves around a nittany lion named ryan buell who would probably be running penn states yearly anime convention if it wasnt for this show he is often accompanied on investigations by hot coeds and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera hey are they ghosts too   this is ryan buells show paranormal state is his vehicle as we like to say in the biz and oh what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be  did i mention ryan narrates the entire episode of paranormal state in a star dateless directors log voice over almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give ryans ghost hunting some gravitas but his filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughs seriously every serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a call of duty video game  the investigations  the plot that each episode revolves around  are interesting on the surface no haunted inns or restaurants to be found in paranormal state this is a show about fearing the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear   small children are harassed things loom in the dark voices encourage the living to kill and the aleister crowely in me rubs my hands of the two episodes i watched each revolved around violent nasty hauntings tied to violent nasty deaths   maybe  maybe not   everything in paranormal state is shorthanded into half hour dog the bounty  er ghost hunter blocks every time there is an interesting verifiable shred of evidence  the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s  the proof is waved in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from nigeria and then yanked away before you can get a good gander   at least with scifi channels ghost hunters there is a somewhat overexhaustive need to trot out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer evps that could be a rat farting cold spots in a drafty house and orbs that even the ghost hunters themselves discount as dust it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters  almost believable  whereas paranormal state claims to have evps but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio yep see an evp right people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling stationary shot of the living room ryan the intrepid leader of this pack of penn state graduates is claiming to see visions of a demons name he knows and that might be involved in a paranormal haunting but he cant tell us the audience or his team of gothed out undergrads because he cant you never say a demons name out loud ryan informs the wide eyed coed who dare inquires  well how very very convenient for you especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind  paranormal state is all turn and no prestige the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair moving or a black blob running between prison cells nothing you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over  if you are going to try and spook me dress it up a little if you are trying to sway me show me a orb or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black orb is really the spirit of an ax murderer and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides trotting out lorraine warren by the second episode  paranormal state is weak sauce not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collection or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water,0
i finally watched the third film in mehtas trilogy fire to begin id say that water was the unquestionable masterpiece on all levels fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality fire there is so much going on in this film that ill need a few more viewings to drink it all in the writing is superb the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships   mehta is one brave lady she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced false and repressive about the great society from which she came from india is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change that she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of water after having had the script cleared shows that there are still many taboo subjects which indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face cannot examine or discuss them worse if someone like mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death threats so as much as india thinks of itself as a pluralistic tolerant society the facts are not always so whereas earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence fire and water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as i say are considered so strongly in a negative sense that an open artistic dialog is still many years away as i write this water is scheduled to actually be shown in india later this year ill believe it when i see it   fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that i saw in a price above rubies whether its arranged marriages which it used to be like among jews about 150 years ago or like it is among many modern indians they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women or just plain loveless marriages however this is not the real issue mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery water or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages fire i am no expert regarding either the secular or hindu laws concerning divorce the film seems to imply that the stigma of divorceis almost as bad as the sad marriage in any case mehtas film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern indian relationships up to probing scrutiny that all three of these films have made themselves felt in india as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack i admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering,1
suzumiya haruhi no yutsu the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedydrama well its not the setting just happen to be a school environment this is a comedy alright but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm and the characters does have a psychological sublimeness which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of ingmar bergman the episodes is aired as it seems out of order ie the pilot is in fact episode 11 this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes the show is an adaption of nagaru tanigawas popular novel series about haruhi suzumiya  what about the story then like in all the episodes does the story revolves haruhi suzumiya who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures haruhi her self has no interest in ordinary humans and actively searches for aliens time travelers and espers persons with supernatural forces to find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the sosbrigade save the world by overloading it with fun haruhi suzumiyas brigade except for haruhi the other members of the sosbrigade is kyon he is the real protagonist of the show its trough his point of view that we follow the story he just happen to sit in front in class when haruhi came up with the idea to form the sosbrigade he is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that haruhi dont go to much to the extremes and he is the only one in the class that haruhi likes to talk with another member is yuki nagato which is the indispensable silent member and is also the only remaining member of the literature club which room the sosbrigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room she doesnt mind that the sosbrigade uses her clubroom as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books she also participate in the brigades activities mikuru asahina was voluntarily arrested by haruhi because the club needed a lolitalike mascot for anything suspicious to happen she often act as the clubs maid the last member is the always smiling itsuki koizumi who happens to be the mysterious transfer student meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which haruhi finds to qualifies as mysterious  haruhi thinks that all members but kyon are some random picked people in school but the do indeed have their own interest in her,1
im still laughing not im still asking my myself what the point was i barely got a chuckle this movie sucks it tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid i do not recommend it,0
like several other reviewers here im surprised to see many negative reviews on this film dan obannons previous effort was the groundbreaking alien of 1979 because it and star wars introduced the stylistic approach of used or dirty space in artdirection for these kinds of features doesnt mean that this was the only way to produce them  rather than dismiss lifeforce outofhand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature its important to recognize that the film draws upon the esteemed traditions of british horror and sciencefiction  specifically hammer and american international features like quatermass specifically quatermass and the pit 1967 doctor who and the day of the triffids 1963 if not the works of gerry anderson ufo space1999 and thunderbirds but none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer obannons genrescholarly appreciation for queen of blood1966 and it the terror from beyond space1958  the immediate sources for alien 1979  granted this film has some legacy elements but perhaps its worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers  1981s an american werewolf in london and the company of wolves 1984  other 80s films that share a lookingback while they adapt those stories to the 80s zeitgeist all three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same but substantially sexedup their themes because they could and at the same time they recognized the tongueincheek humorous aspects of their projects  neil jordans wolves played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the 80s while american werewolf curdled its theme as a comingofage film its called artistic license and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latterday dramedy inherent in the scream franchise i know what you did last summer and final destination but these teentargeted films seem to be part of a boxoffice trend whereas the 80s films like lifeforce belong a canon of british scifi  even if this one was written by an american  in many ways this film holds up much better than latterday disaster and alieninvasion flicks independence day armageddon deep impact in that the solutions dont reside in gunbattles weaponized payloads and testosterone at the opposite end of the pole it is unfortunate that steven soderbergh and james cameron didnt examine tarkowski and lem more closely before they remade solaris  the goal of this film was fun not ponderousness or stupidity  710,1
nagisa no shindobaddo or like grains of sand is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one with who they are this movie isnt about homosexuality but it is about sexuality  aihara an aloof girl will definitely make the viewers ponder who is behind the aloof girl does she love yoshida or does she love ito or did she somehow turn into a lesbian because of the incident i doubt it  and what about yoshida does he realize that he loves ito in the end well we all know he loves him as a friend but youll never know once you see this movie haha  in the end aihara along with ito delivers an exceptional message to the audience which is that it does not matter if you love a boy or a girl and i have to tell you im so dense that i didnt get it at first  its because of the whole no talking scenes you have to try to understand what the characters are thinking and saying through their actions and not by what they say especially the final part whew boy that was confusing its a confusing story but it is beautiful nonetheless  this movie is certainly one of the best japanese movies i have ever seen and trust me ive seen plenty,1
wow this movie sucked  this movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlot  everything about this movie was awful  the acting was horrendous every part except the part of the mexican sandlot manager was terrible  luke perry though only bit parts was absolutely awful this was is worst role ever even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone youd want to punch even in the end lol  this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage the humor was for 6 year olds  if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead,0
i just watched the movie tonight and i found it brilliant it doesnt have special effects that blow your mind and its not violent or bloody no terrorist or aliens but its brilliant its just plain nice sweet and it brought me to a whole different time a much simpler time where people could take their time to walk down the street and look out at the ocean i think it was beautiful and i for one recommend it nick was a great character and his friendship with harry was one of the highlights of the movie everyone is entitled to their opinion but i believe everyone should watch this mostly when they feel down or when they want to share something nice with their friends,1
this is one of those movies that are very underrated again i am voting for an underrated movie this movie has a good story line maybe a bit farfetched but it could happen sean astinone of my favorite actors again shows us a good performance the guy does a great job in acting but never gets recognized for his roles he has done well since the goonies not only him but louis gosset jr does a swell job i thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters but who cares about money anyways all around this is a good movie that will have you at the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving itself i enjoyed this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well,1
the film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of russia i wont deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time filmed 1928 but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures ranging from a one arm man beating a horse to a toothless soldier in the war everything in between is awkward haphazard and quite unnecessary it would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant  in all one should view this if they are an art student on hallucinogenic drugs or a student of pretarkovskian cinema,0
fate puts a pair of priceless items in ernests hands and he gets kidnapped and taken to africa because of it this was my first ernest film so i cant compare it to his others but i thought it was fairly amusing good stuff if you like slapstick humor and plain old clowning around,1
bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct american animation company filmation on the back of heman masters of the universe and shera princess of power in 1983 and 87 respectively the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall bravestarr who possesses the strength of the bear ears of the wolf speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk and his trusty sidekick a talking horse named thirty thirty who carried with him a gun aptly titled sarah jane and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge jb serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlaws  set in futuristic texas this was and still is to this day one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city in the us hence in the south thousands of light years ahead in the future considering this was made in the 80s the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a scifi based outlook bravestarr didnt just evoke morality and good verses bad as well as teaching children lessons about life but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldnt take things and life for granted and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon many of the story lines themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them in addition marshall bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ethnicminority background to make an impact on tv  the sound effects were amazing the music was great the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong something of which the same cannot be said about todays cartoons sadly  whilst bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of heman it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics suffice to say i preferred bravestarr over heman because of the diversity of the story lines characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast for some reason they resonated more with people because like for instancein the pledge where a kid dies from a drug overdose the fact that there wasnt a happy ending was important in the sense that when kids watch that episode well in fact anyone who watches that episode will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs  bold brave and at times thoughtprovoking bravestarr is definitely that bold brave and thought provoking a cult cartoon classic for many years to come it dared to take some risks but it had well and truly paid off in the end it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever and rightly so  8 and a half out of ten,1
black day blue night was actually good modern noir three young nomads on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere as most modern noir does one woman finds that her husband is cheating on her and after finding him in a hotel room decides to head off and start anew strangely enough she travels with her husbands mistress who is forgiveable given that the sleazebag never told her he was married and together while driving in the pouring rain they meet a third very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets while theyre giddy and free and all suspicious of one another the cops back at town have them marked as suspects in the death of a policeman  black day blue night starts out with immediate confrontation and throws in a pretty good story with all its twists meant to mislead your suspicions of one character after another leading to a very unusual ending that is the movie starts with immediate action confrontation and once you think the story is solved you are immediately thrust into yet another turn in the plot revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie is over   but as some viewers have written the ending is slightly confusing and a bit of a let down the killer is not who you would immediately expect and once revealed becomes somewhat confusing due to a rather thinly explained flashback which reveals all of the necessary motive to solve the mystery but actually there is a finale beyond that which i would think is the most interesting of the film because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects almost always all of them guilty of something it is also a genre that always involves money and thus the question in these movies always becomes how far are the characters willing to go for money  if you like this rendition of modern film noir i would suggest watching red rock west its also got jt walsh and some goingons in the blasted desert,1
ok so herc is a hunk but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted wasted oh the humanity  poor sean astin had to follow his master up the very same hills of new zealand that  wait couldd it be someone in the production crew of lord of the rings was making home movies in his spare time yes thats it  i wish i could at least say he was promising  the special effects were often laughable  but herc was a hunk  nh,0
this movie turned out to be better than i had expected it to be some parts were pretty funny it was nice to have a movie with a new plot,1
oz is one of the most mindblowing and addictive tv experiences ever  having caught pieces of this on sbs i was at first skeptical however having finished now the 4th season i sadly know that that this brilliant show is approaching its end 6 seasons and yet i still cant get enough of oz   want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limitoz fits the bill hands down  this isnt kids stuff folks its violent brutal and not pretty why its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison  tom fontanas oz is brilliant in all the right departments the actors the writing and directing  hbos oz site is also highly recommended for newcomers for info about this series this was the first onehour show produced by hbo and it proves what a masterwork it is and that others would follow  thankyou hbo,1
i cant believe they even released such a movie the only good acting came from the water in the movie this has to be one of worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen  the only scary part of the movie is the bad acting me giving this movie a 1 is me being to kind this movie deserve a 0  the storyline and if you can call it the plot of the movie seems to have been written by an high school kid ofcaurse you have to ask yourself if it may have been better with better actors in it  do yourself a favor wait for it to show on tv   and even then watching it will be a wast of time,0
i cant believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic im a million miles from being an expert and im never going to climb a mountain but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading into thin air and watching everest beyond the limit and a few other everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on there is some good climbing footage at the start and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film how much experience above 8000 metres do you have i was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate manvsnature odyssey instead you have a bunch of climbers zooming up a mountain with no acclimatisation climbing with goggles off in full sun and they are barely ever out of breath performing miraculous feats of endurance only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak almost as an afterthought if you have no knowledge of mountaineering give it a look be prepared for some clichd heroics although no more clichd than a hundred other passably diverting flicks and a clichd outcome ive been developing a minor fascination with high mountains and was looking forward to watching k2 but other than some amazingly beautiful scenery it was a let down because it was so far removed from reality i can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie but then being conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic and sadly fantastical storyline also you would sound like a bit of a tit if you said welcome to the death zone at 200000 feet,0

one of the best film i ever saw  the performance of louis jouvet is fantastic he really fill his part and this is wonderful hes such a good actor that you cant think of anyone else to take his part   and both suzy delair and bernard blier are good as standard french people trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder  the story is breathtaking and well built you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period which is about 193040 between two wars the clubs the old little buildings the neighbors  all those things contribute to make a great movie,1
the story is derived from king lear the setting is a farm in iowa heres a test for this kind of thing if you find yourself asking why did soandso do suchandsuch and the answer is because thats what happened in king lear you know that the film has failed well that is what happens here the father figure in this story isnt living his own life hes mimicking a fictional one but theres more wrong with the film than this  jocelyn moorhouse is ambitious  far more ambitious than i think she realises shes trying to take the king lear story and completely change the setting this is a task in itself the likeliest result is that the transplanted story will die and nobody will quite be able to work out why although there are enough successful transplants like west side story to make it worth trying but shes also attempting a revisionist retelling in the version of king lear she wishes to create reagan and goneril command our sympathy and cordelia is a villain this is a task in itself too  succeeding at either task is hard succeeding at both at once is impossible in fact succeeding at one while so much as attempting the other is impossible if we are to look on the very same events from a different moral perspective then the events must be the very same events  which means there can be no tampering with setting if the story is to be transplanted alive into a different setting its moral heart must keep beating the whole while  which means there can be no tampering with ethical perspective moorhouse was bound to fail in not just one but in both of her endeavours and so she did naturally its possible to attempt both tasks fail at both tasks yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art thats good for independent reasons i mention this because i havent read jane smileys novel which for all i know is good for independent reasons but the film isnt if there was nothing else wrong with it there would still be no getting around the fact that its just so thoroughly excruciatingly dull the very fields of corn are even more boring than they would be in real life  which neednt be the case since off the top of my head i can think of four films the wizard of oz north by northwest the straight story kikujiro in which the cornfields arent boring at all,0
we all know that special effects cost money but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots the train is obviously a model in most moving shots the helicopter is obviously computer generated the alien looks like the one from the end of spaceballs except its a decade later and spaceballs had an excuse  the only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see  not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and its pretty obvious they didnt really try either  please dont waste your time please,0
being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind but still this isnt a bad movie by any means its a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who cant seem to get out of trouble whats wrong with that it doesnt have any big special effects but so what who needs special effects cinemas decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized a coincidence i think not it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big substanceless light show for innocent kids and the selfmedicated well you know not all movies need special effects about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top 250 are without special effects but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects think about it star wars et ghostbusters etc all good movies but the rest of the topgrossing movies are usually cliched tripe with nonsensical plots and lots of eye candy well some movies dont need ny of that junk  excuse me for going off on a tangent which i normally do but im just so fed up with that special effects junk back to the point toy soldiers is simply a great movie i admit some of the content is a little corny and ripped off but so what every movie rips off another to some extent think of resovoir dogs countless appreciation sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino who i admit i like has copied many many many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr tarentino loved so much and probably still does sorry once again for the tangent  toy soldiers is fun it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority ie hostage takers its fun to see kids take over when theyre being held to something they dont want to do hell teenage angstinspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to 80s comedies plus theres the tension and thrill of having the characters use firearms and knock out the bad guys etc plus theres some emotional points to the film when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust its not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out there  in short toy soldiers is exciting interesting and fun how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly shame on you all  personal rating 810,1
i would probably say this was on a par with films like devils rain and that sort of film although this is probably a bit better made i love 70s horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria seems like the children have been disappearing after an initial attempt to flee this place the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town theyre all satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service i guess not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise this is fairly classy considering that its scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today which seem to have replaced actual scares we have hank kimball alvy moore from green acres as tobey a sheriffs deputy that reads ufo magazines and lq jones as the sheriff and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family and strother martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes but overall works pretty well  is recommended for fans of 70s horror 8 out of 10,1
who will love my children saddest movie i have ever seen definite 1010 released on tv in 1983 movie has been released on vhs dvd release is a must sooner rather than later mother dying of cancer must find homes for all her children before she dies because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the kids is not capable of caring for them once she has died she manages to find homes for the children except one a young boy whom is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy very sad when your not wanted in for a real good tear jerker get your hands on this movie im a male even i cried when i watched this movie not to be missed,1
shirley temples films for twentieth century fox arent negligible because theyre poorlymade darryl f zanuck supervised most of them after all they dont retain much of a classic stature among cinema aficionados mainly because theyre weighed down with the syrupy optimism of depressionera hollywood 1930s audiences were placated by the delight of seeing a dimply often orphaned sunshine girl making the grownups look foolish by comparison they fretted and wrung their hands while she danced her troubles away seen these many years later temples vehicles barely get by on story aided always by musical sequences to bolster the content and her timing always tooperfect and exaggerated reactions might leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes no one could possibly be blamed for their exasperation over temples performance here shouting lines at the top of her lungs or the perverseness of her dance steps sashaying with a crowd of sailors to at the codfish ball still the fantasy aspect of this particular story previously filmed in 1924 from the book by laura e richard is enough to captivate those in the proper saccharine spirit seems shirl was pulled from a shipwreck by a governmentappointed lighthouse keeper but when a truant officer from the state board finds out the tyke isnt in school she threatens to take the kid away it doesnt really matter if the prunefaced officer has a point that temple isnt being raised properly the woman is turned into the proverbial villainess almost immediately one can see right away that temple can hold her own taking care of herself and her elderly guardian in the bargain as well as the local widow who has her hooks in for the captain temple isnt the only one overlyrehearsed guy kibbees january is cued for wideeyed reactions so often you wonder if maybe if he didnt film them all in one day the dialogue is steeped in waterfront metaphors you cant rush a trout  well dont give up the ship and something about the whole enterprise seems strangely pixilated  from,0
let me get this out of the way before i trash this film i love park chanwooks work as a director while i disagree with the masses saying hes is the best director working in our time i cant deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively i really liked one of his other films sympathy for mr vengeance also minsik chois acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously    for 15 of the runtime that is  now the bad the plot is simply the oldest clich used in cinemaliterature ill never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being clich then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichd if not even more so regardless oldboy is flatout one of the most generic unoriginal movies ever conceived spoilers man is held captive man seeks revenge man finds out he had sex with a family member mans life is over end spoilers simply put this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless moviesbooks in between it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens i laughed out loud does that mean im a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me no what it means overdone plots make people laugh the scary movie franchise proved that and oldboy proved it as well why cant people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichs masked with fancy camerawork and classical music that brings up the issue of bloodgore simply put it isnt there the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something gory happens as if were watching a childrens movie or something maybe we were anyway ive heard oldboy called the most brutal movie of all time and the most disturbing movie ever but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing all the gore is offscreen and even then the violence level is nothing you havent seen in pg13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before why this even got an rrating confuses me much less the most brutal movie of all time seriously ive seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violencegore  the other huge glaring cheesy flaw is the main villain the majority of his screen time hes showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american piestyle but im supposed to think hes ohsoevil when hes wearing clothes his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers he talks like a braindead teenager recovering from an acid overdose and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again seriously oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year     in the end oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties its for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the films never movies they enjoy are  to those people all i can say is this i like films and also like movies i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma but the thing is for me to like both films and movies they have to be original they have to be something i havent seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used when something isnt original its expendable if it does exactly what everyone else does its forgettable and boring before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it touched you maybe you should think about something wouldnt a movie equally as touching but at the same time original make you think more i just wish someone other than me would understand this  overall oldboy is forgettable and cheesy  110,0
bad bad movie when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape nothing of the sorts happened ill admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it  first of all choosing real life person countess bathory is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much much better  then there is whole youdieinreallifeasyoudieinthegame concept as i said before interesting ringlike story but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is why it was created and so on waste of good idea  and finally this movie doesnt even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny  avoid if possible,0
this film has an amazing cast mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret obrien lionel barrymore edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home while they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name sort of like carnegie but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to obrien and since shes an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great philanthropists  there also is a goofy subplot involving fairiesled by the wonderful character actor henry davenport and since obrien is irish as evidenced by her outrageous accent she and the little people make up much of the plot frankly i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished theyd just dropped it entirely instead the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old mens heartsthis would have worked butthe little people sheesh overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe i noticed a lot of people liked this filmi guess im just an old grouch i found the film horrible difficult to watch,0
the best thing  and thats pretty good  about the black castle is that its a blackand white forties gothic grabber featuring a murderous mad count which was somehow made in 1952 the star ostensibly is the british actor richard greene a capable leading man who reminds me of an earlier version of roger moore the villain is a mad count played by stephen mcnally who does a credible job except when hes called on to laugh maniacally skulking around in the shadows is a longgowned boris karloff in a decidedly secondary role of an aged doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero   its the middle of the 18th century in austria and sir ronald burton greene is determined to find out what happened to two close friends they disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to count karl von bruno mcnally deep in the black forest it seems that sir ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von brunos in africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory the count was left not only with failure but with a scar on his face and a black patch he now wears to cover a ruined eye von bruno vowed revenge and it seems he might have been partially successful so under a false name sir ronald arranges for a hunting invitation from the count and off we go by carriage through a dark journey of storm and howling wolves to the counts castle its a hulking mass of stone turrets and corridors shadowy stairways huge fireplacesand creepy passages that lead to dank dungeon cells a torture chamber and a great pit filled with snapping thrashing crocodiles it also is filled by the counts lovely blond sensitive wife elga paula corday who sometimes is billed as rita corday and by the counts two close friends played by those two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being slime in costume john hoyt and michael ansara there is a dangerous leopard hunt forbidden kisses knuckling servants wooden signs creaking and swaying in the cold wind and poison in a cup not the least doctor meissen karloff has a special vial filled with a drug which will so slow the bodily functions that death will seem to have occurred the risk is thatwell when the person awakes ten hours later hed better hope hes not already nailed shut in his coffin   surprisingly for all the clichs the black castle keeps moving merrily along the movie takes itself seriously but its competently enough made to keep our interest even if we wind up sitting back with a smile while we watch its even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game when burton realizes just how crazy von bruno is he becomes even more determined to bring von bruno to accounts and naturally he has fallen for elga von bruno crazed by vengeance yet crafty and capable is a man who loves the hunt and is engorged by the kill hollywoods second creative rule has always been if youre going to steal steal from the best its first creative rule of course is if youre going to steal steal from the best and then turn it into liverwurst the black castle is a nice bite of austrian braunschweiger,1
ive never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky im glad i did i hope i dont insult anybody because basically the bf and i loved it but we couldnt take it half as seriously as the actors did  especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because weve seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in hamleys the bf keeps on about this bloke  i am beginning to think hes obsessed he keeps saying that its strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the antihero of a film but then we do like films that arent your stock predictable hollywood fare  it was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then were watching more i have had that bloomin song in my head all week and i cant speak a word of hindi ps any recommendations would be appreciated,1
i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it but beyond that the shows whole format is incredibly annoying even though a lot of it seems scripted the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use big words they obviously dont understand and head investigator ryans ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window and he looks stoned all the time in short this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists,0
hulk hogan stars as a champion wrestler a real acting stretch named rip who is forced to defend his honor his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network because wrestling sells however when rip declines the network gets a circuit fighting championship called and im totally serious battle of the tough guys whos champion zeus played by tiny lister jr maybe the deadliest man alive rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital no holds barred is pretty much what i expected from vince mcmahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre hogan it is basically lots of unintentional humor tons of awkward sequences a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity in other words its not unlike wrestling itself so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what theyre getting the movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this i myself found this to be ultimately hilarious theyre are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself such as the way hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limo how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way hogan recites from his cuecard ieim not going to be around when this check clears no holds barred is a lot of fun true though its mainly because of how ridiculous it is fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker    out of 4fair,0
this movie was so poorly acted what was with jeff bridges accent horrible and unbelievable was it supposed to be french scandinavianthe script was lame to have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the jeff bridges characterare you kidding me how convenient that jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn do these people just not believe in calling the cops okayill get into the car with you why not duh why was bridges daughter obsessed with making her dad have an affair is her mother that evil or just plain dull i did not see the original it would be hard to make myself after seeing this movie,0
i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it it really touched me and i thoroughly enjoyed noel cowards work in it highly recommended atmospheric and touching  i think of this film from time to time and am disappointed it hasnt enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films hadnt realized til i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben hecht and charles macarthur  basically it involves a nasty character who destroys anothers career and is cursed because of it he dies but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal well written and lovely i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on tv late one night in new york a must see if you ever have the opportunity,1
classe tous risques feels like the granddaddy of the sopranos in mixing the criminal and the domestic and of the buddy film to feel as contemporary as reservoir dogs  even as these gangsters are affectionately entangled with wives children lovers and parents they are coldly ruthless and we are constantly reminded they are no matter what warm situation we also see them in they can tousle a kids hair  and then shoot a threat in cold blood the key is loyalty and the male camaraderie is beautifully conveyed without ethnic or class stereotypes even as their web of past obligations and pay backs narrows into suspicion and paranoia as the old gang is in various stages of parole retirement out on bail or into new less profitable ventures an intense accusation is of sending a stranger to perform an old escape scenario it is a high point of emotion when a wife is told off that shes not the one the gangster is friends with while virtually the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he recalls his wife  streetscapes in italy and france are marvelously used in blinding daylight to dark water and highways from the opening set up of a pair of brazen robbers  who are traveling with ones wife and two kids rugged craggy lino ventura captures the screen immediately as the criminal dad and the second thug is clearly a casually avuncular presence in their lives as they smoothly coordinate the theft and escape in cars buses on boats and motorcycles in easy tandem this is not the clich crusty old guy softened with the bigeyed orphan these are their jobs and their families and they intersect in horrific ways  the film pulls no punches in unexpectedly killing off characters directly and as collateral damage and challenging our sympathy for them right through to the unsentimental end which is probably why there was never an american remake   it seems so fresh that its not until jeanpaul belmondo enters almost a third of the way into the film looking so insouciant as a young punk that one realizes that this is from 1960 sultry sandra milo has smart and terrific chemistry with him from an ambulance to an elevator to a hospital bed  while the film forum was showing a new 35 mm print with newly translated subtitles it was not pristine the program notes explained that the title refers to a kind of insurance policy and is pun on tourist class,1

in the belarus of 1942 two soviet soldiers are captured by nazifriendly belarusians in captivity the attitude of the two men toward their fate differs greatly one of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality incomprehensible to the other man larisa shepitkos last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history the cinematography by vladimir chuchnov is incredible  particularly in the opening sequence where long slow tracking shots depicting the solitude and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural belarus set the mood perfectly it is easy to draw comparison to tarkovskys films even more so since tarkovskys alter ego anatoli solonitsyn has a small but important part in the ascent the acting is overall brilliant especially by boris plotnikov in the part of sotnikov the film reveals an oldfashioned belief in the strength of religious passion which feels related to characters such as dostoyevskys prince myshkin or tarkovskys stalker however this is not a weakness of the film but rather one of its greatest strengths the religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to be moved the emotional richness of the film cannot be overstated the answer is not as simplified as a short summary of the plot would make you think the slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other are somewhat reminiscent of the commissar another great soviet film the ascent deserves a second watching as well as a third and a tenth it continues to provide interesting ideas beautiful images and emotional complexity,1
this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime the acting atrocious the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers after watching this movie it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours also a bottle of valium would be recommended so you dont feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life the plot is nothing original the dialog excruciating and even the weapons seem subpar do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film,0
this movie is a shameful result of what happens when  a it is written directed and produced by an idiot andor b it was rushed in production to satiate the pokerstu ungar craze   the story from beginning is uneven vidmer spends too much time on ungars childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales  such as counting cards his blackjack escapades the roll of money as id he also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese brunson etc the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end   if you want a more complete and accurate account read the book one of a kind if you thought the movie was good read the book and change your mind,0
the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between guangzhou china and los angeles it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par even by normal standards also the subtitling is little to small blends into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well,1
this is surely british humour at its best it tends to grow on you the first time i watched it i couldnt quite figure out what it was all about but now i can watch the episodes over and over again and enjoy them every time,1
this film is about a young mans painful journey to discovering his sexuality  the film is raw and unpretentious it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times and some events are not properly explained i can understand it though because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life  the low budget of the film is clearly discernible it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done the narration and some dialogs particularly the scene in the classroom with the french teacher have so much echo which makes it hard to make out what is said the ambient noise notable traffic noise is also captured throughout the film when a scene cuts into another the level of traffic noise changes  this film is probably not entertaining but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young mans journey to embracing his sexuality,0
let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts and did fairly well in their roles but the movie lacked any real plot it seemed so wraped up in seeming wacky that no interesting story ever shone through also the camera work was often sloppy attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably most of the time shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing perhaps something was lost during translation but some of the characters were just stupid the crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog uhhhhhhh ok overall a fat stinking 110 not worth your time,0
not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched the viewer is irrestiblely drawn into the movie involving 5 young men working together to try and overcome insumaintable odds sean astin as billy tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles from terussell wil wheaton and shawn phelan the guidance and leadership of gossets and astins characters makes the movie so much better as time goes on the movie keeps gathering momentum and its a dissapointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie,1
like almost everyone i am familiar with the music of ray charles who hasnt heard georgia on my mind and the messaround and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly his performance was powerful right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections the movie also offered a noholdsbarred account of some of the trials and tribulations charles dealt with over the course of his life and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene which was painfully realistic the movie portrays charles growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in georgia which led to a ban on him performing in the state his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented the movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child dont let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple the point is that drugs did just that and to honour his mothers memory he had to beat them theres not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point this is really powerful stuff 910,1
corny and some really bad acting but for a golanglobus film about right on par saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery filmswhat was i thinking arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the worldbrigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was slys girl and a pretty bad actressmovie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord kalidorthere is also sandahl bergmanwho was in the original conan movie as valeriahere she plays the evil queen gedrenan obvious camp to her conan role and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreenernie reyesas prince tarn who should have been slapped hard and sent to bedwhat a little irritating scut some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks special effects are cheap and look very 70s like the explosion of the evil queens castle at the climax of the movie   overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness,0
i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadnt seen one that i hadnt liked  the premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if youre short on funds maybe you shouldnt have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision   there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems   two final questions  who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now  how many times did this guy say man,0
i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me but i think i have an idea one of the fat guys at the movies the person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriestdisturbing movies im paraphrasing and doing this only by memory so forgive me if i misquoted at any rate i made the decision to watch it so i take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible predictable and stupid movies ive ever seen strange i doubt ive ever called a movie stupid but that was the first word that came to mind about onethird in and stayed in my mind until the end  where to begin unbelievable premise and reactions incredibly braindead characters could blame the writing or the actors or ill just blame both and enormously bad acting id sooner believe bill pullman as president of the usa than a fbi agent here of course theres a reason for that and ill partially go into that and to top it off if you cant figure the socalled shocking twist in the first 5 minutes then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late dont worry theyll tell you the twist every five minutes thereafter  theres been some serial killers on the loose in the most depressing town in the county or world but theres more to the story some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement could there possibly be more oh yeah theres a family well maybe not but there are four humans one boy one girl and an adult couple the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense theres gotta be more to this than what i mentioned thats what makes a movie interesting adding as many subplots that maymay not be developed is the way to go okay then ill continue we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh a pair of giggling druggies whos shocked at first their dealer ods but then resorts to robbery a goshtooting greatguy cop who mustve been put in for comic relief whos always battling an angrysuspicious cop and finally poor poor michael ironside who didnt just phone his performance in he barely text it in  none of these work theyre all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks and believe me youll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin in addition the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all i guess im referring mostly to the cops but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks  this stupid stupid movie stinks its barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was unless his exposure has been limited to goosebumps stories and whats with the title surveillance oh i get it its because it was used in 150 subplots just to film interviews since thats so random it might as well been called cop car bullet or coffee just stay away from this horrid mess,0
bog creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash some knowledge of movie making a mixed bag of aspiring actors and a lot of determination yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking after school special in a bad way not a nostalgic good way i mean this is soso quality home movie  student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free thankfully i found it in a discount bin somewhere sure there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing but it is a market that seems to only exist by default because there are so many poor b movies out there even more so now in this day and age  the only people i would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers first i would recommend that they watch the special feature making of thing included on the disc see the film crews enthusiasm their hard work joy and very high opinions of their own product then watch the movie within a few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong bored i went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried but just dont know enough about what they are doing they knew enough to have fun but in the long run without necessary skills this interprets to they knew enough to be dangerous this is like a bad nickelodeon movie as apposed to a more decent one i guess a couple of the actors did ok and the cool stoner looking dude with the tattoo real or fake tattoo i know not was probably the best and most natural and i hope he makes it but their natural acting talent was what was coming through despite the bad movie bad script and soso directing principles if the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters studying successfully proven camera techniques and lighting principles to direct his crew better and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in a week or so according to the very indulgent documentary then maybe this could have been more of a film instead its a film that has a feeling of some potential and has a few moments in it due more to the genre than the film itself but ends up showing nearly every frame what not to do if you want to see what a decent low budget horror movie can really look like watch phantasm or even laserblast if you want a glorified home movie no joke get bog creatures,0
peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film on her majestys secret service considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like gold and shout at the devil both adapted from wilbur smith novels gullivers travels is an odd one on his list of films it seems strange that a director of hunts style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind a halflive actionhalfanimated retelling of jonathan swifts classic satire the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made and in all honesty it simply doesnt work and theres not a damn thing that hunt with his usual eye for fastpaced action or star richard harris who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles can do to rescue this one  lemuel gulliver richard harris is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol his father norman shelley wants him to go to london to make his fortune but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ships surgeon aboard a ship called the antelope during a voyage the antelope is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef the ship sinks and everyone is lost apart from gulliver who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of lilliput when he comes round gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans no taller than his toe to them he looks like a giant they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island but gulliver doesnt like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation so he makes plans to escape  harris is left to carry the entire film here his first couple of scenes involve other actors but once he is shipwrecked in lilliput he spends the rest of the film striding over kneehigh sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time but it certainly hadnt been done a lot a few disney movies like song of the south so dear to my heart and petes dragon had tampered with the idea but it was still pretty much in its infancy gullivers travels is not an especially wellanimated film but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon costars are at least competently done occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins theres one scene where we learn that lilliput has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs   and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things but at its heart this is very much a kids film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon everyone involved has done better things during their career  gullivers travels might fill an otherwise empty afternoon but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience,0
i love these awful 80s summer camp movies the best part about party camp is the fact that it literally has no plot it simply drops a weak batch of characters into a location and then things occasionally happen the cliches here are limitless spoilers the nerds vs the jocks the secret camera in the girls locker room the hikers happening upon a nudist colony the contest at the conclusion the secretly horny camp administrators and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout the only cliche missing is the presence of corey feldman this movie will make you laugh but never intentionally i repeat never a final note be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the dramatic scene where jerry riviera and da share a beer late at night spilling their guts to each other the dialogue literally makes no sense and the acting belongs on a highschool stage its a classic,0
i just dont know how this stupid crap junk garbage  good for nothing film is a blockbuster it was so boring with a very very weak or no storyline and wasnt even a jot funny the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem salman khan is a love guru and is helping hapless  romantic bhaskar govinda to get the girl he wants im not saying that i didnt like the film because it wasnt funny or anything i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story the only two reasons why i can say its a superhit are   1 salman khan  govinda are onscreen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it cant be but it was a really good movie  2 salman khans name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya so its just luck  i heard that its a remake of hitch ive not seen it  im glad i didnt music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner youre my love  soni de nakhre but what is the use of it in a really bad film that too if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet she is completely crap neither she knows acting language her voice is always dubbed for her dance and always fails to impress i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again,0
personally i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation maybe the greatest this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges it cant be bad and thats exactly what this movie is kpax is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story its part of what makes the movie so great the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting the combination spaceybridges really works  this was already the second time i saw the movie and im sure it wont be the last time kpax has everything there are moments which are extremely funny parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of highclass drama i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards great movie   910,1
simply put this movies is without any substance whatsoever just take my word for it and save yourself the time it is a complete dud i would say the characters are one dimensional but that would imply there was some sort of character development i thought eric roberts was going to jump out any second it was so close to bmovie status   the girl from that 70s is beautifulbut unless you are a stalker type fan of hers this movie has nothing for anyone   avoidavoidavoid  this movie was straight to dvd for a reasonthat beingit is a train wreck,0
this movie is one of the most memorable films i have seen i went reluctantly with a turkish friend who recommended it i am not a very enthusiastic proponent of music documentaries but when aynur dogan a kurdish woman banned for years from singing in turkey sings her piece the theater was in awe i would give my all to hear a cd recording of this haunting gorgeous song and she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded speaking of their experiences of performing in istanbul even now a month later i remember the footage of aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium and i try to remember the music as it echoed in the cinema well done to faith akin the director of this film and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a cosmopolitan city it would certainly encourage me to visit istanbul,1
11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on imdb there is a reason for this utter lack of interest in across the moon it is coherent but lacks all cinematic virtue see this film for examples of terrible production in all respects the opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background the ending features michael mckean staring out a prison window saying theres lots of mysteries out there followed by a clip montagemusic video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie julinana hatfield everything in between is awful i struggled to find any value in this movie and have come up empty though it is hard to believe even a cameo role from burgess meridith always a crowd pleaser only disappointed me further this movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies on paper the movie is below average women living together in a trailer but what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable the movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any the unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved no conflict is ever resolved there really is no conflict the women attempt to become hookers but that never happens instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf stocker sound exciting it wasnt it was stupid and the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and generating contrived conflict the women are capable actresses but the script was beyond poor useless this was a terrible movie but it is even worst that they borough burgess meridith out of his retirement home to make it bad from start to finish like the lion without teeth this film has no bite,0
this almost perfect cinematic rendition of edith nesbits popular childrens novel follows the lives of roberta bobbie phyllis and peter and their mother after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison they go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line  mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and specifically waving to one particular train to send their love to father  always an involving and clever novel the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of lionel jeffries better known as a fine character actor jenny agutter plays bobbie while sally thomsett and gary warren are her sister and brother their mother is dinah sheridan while the other memorable characters are played by bernard cribbins perks the railwayman and william mervyn the old gentleman on the train  the railway children is gentle entertainment from another age but does its job beautifully as we watch bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture throughout we have a sense of time and place  be it from the steam trains the university paper chase or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls and used to avert disaster,1
i have not seen a van damme flick for a while pleasantly surprised he still has it looking older but tougher kind of like sly becomes more rugged with age this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire that was a good flick as well in addition i looked in to van dammes early fighting history i too my amazement i realized he is the real deal very accomplished martial artist in his younger years,1
even worse then the incredibly boring the exorcism of emily rose it started off decently and right up until the mom said to the dad see i knew she was possessed in an i told you so voice it was a terrible line spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie every family member has an issue from the past with the priest the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her culminating with him killing his buddy then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadnt slept with his wife after all people are dying others are coming under possession and by this point most viewers dont even care anymore except for their employee miguel none of the characters in this movie was actually likable making it hard to care about any of them the acting was terrible and the writing even worse glad i saw it for free although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost,0
when i played the first soul calibur on dreamcast i thought it was great when i played the second i was hooked and finally when soul calibur iii was released i bought a playstation 2 and the game  this can really keep you up for hours with a huge amount of characters loads of unlockable content and not to mention a great fighting system this really is the greatest fighting game to date   the games strong points is foremost the vs gameplay were two human players battle each other either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and customized character the create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations  the only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style grieve edge only kicks has to wear those ridiculous shoes   this is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for now im just hoping the planned movie wont be crap,1
overall the movie heart of darkness was pitiful compared to the book anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws there is an immeasurable difference between the two it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle i couldnt imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating heart of darkness the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret conrads story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation  first capturing the details of the story is unattainable the colossal fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film marlows feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie if you have taken on the enormous task of tackling conrads work then you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader you as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting joseph conrads ideas as a result several crucial details are absent in the movie  also although the movie was an adequate length the film seemed short it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters marlow was much more of a stranger the viewpoint of the book puts you into marlows shoes however in the movie youre almost watching marlow from a distance i began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same read between the lines method as conrad did however the connections were weak i know that if i had not read the book then i would in no way be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters  finally kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly his role was short and the details werent all included it was impossible to comprehend the true kurtz in the length of time he was shown an important detail in the book was that kurtz had become a god to the africans i didnt think that significant detail was defined also in the book kurtz represented a soulless being he had died inside long ago i believe the director comprehended this detail however instead of recreating it he just had kurtz mope around and mumble everything moreover it seemed like the director attempted to make kurtz seem mysterious however instead he seemed entirely unidentified  altogether this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project due the next day it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time the characters were alienated crucial details were left out and overall the central plot was lost in translation,0
i cant believe i sat through this garbage palm trees in dc already mentioned a dummyasdeadbody bit so obviously artificial that i thought it was supposed to be a dummy  until it left a bloodstain  stilted dialogue ridiculous plot i think its a shame that jill irelands final film before her death was this stinker dont waste your time  i wish i hadnt the only saving grace is that it was on cable so i didnt waste my money on top of everything,0
the idea that anyone could of concocted such a trite clich yet indeliberately comical movie is shocking the final 20 minutes of this film are comical glory with six men digging enough trench in 10 minutes to light the runway with gasoline for a 747 while a supposed major perfectly lands the 747 in a 110mph crosswind  leading one to question the misnomer of calling this movie crash landing  some of the dialogue was equivalent to rubbing sandpaper in my ears while the only aspect that saved this movie for a 1 was the plethora of attractive women filling the screen a large portion of the time not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic excuse of a movie but my mute button finally received a workout  view at your own risk 2 out of 10,0
i had watched this as a kid but not being much of a jerry lewis fan i had completely forgotten it not that its in any way memorable the film revolves around impersonation which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star  in this case a german officer  and while not as bad as leonard maltin claims awarding it a bomb rating its not exactly classic stuff either  certainly leagues behind chaplins the great dictator 1940 even if comparably narcissistic ironically the scenes prior to the appearance of the wouldbe wacky general offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at nazi expense   the film was really lewis last gasp during his heyday in fact this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years its painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldnt pass muster in the age of mel brooks and woody allen,0
i have seen this movie and anybody who has every been with the marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie it is a must have for any collection jack webb does an excellent job as the hard drill instructor my father went to marine boot camp at camp penelton and says this movie is so accurate that he feels like he is back in basic training there is a line in the movie where jack webbs character gets mad at a boot for killing a sand flea well let me tel you there are nothing but sand fleas at the camp i have been there and can appreciate it as a matter of fact the exit to the camp is las puljas which in english means city of the fleas you must watch the movie to appreciate what i am saying anybody who is into wwii movies all the battles start right here with the drill sgt a must have for you collection,1
not only unique for its time but one of the greatest science fiction films of all time made without cgi on a very lean budget in todays adjusted figures stanley kubrick made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has stanley kubrick is without doubt the greatest director in history thus far  this film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superb  stanley kubrick and the great aurthur c clarke collaborated to write this time less classic  aliens a special message on earth at the dawn of human kind and one on the moon which modern man finds   finally humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of to jupiter the find the next monumental message which turns out to be a gateway  any one who studied film andor wishes to be a part of the film industry or just enjoy great films must experience this film   if you dont like it then you belong to bollywood or your a true aussie,1
this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch i just dont like that socalled realistic camera work that is being done nowadays you know the type jumping off center panning around etc what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldnt concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the camera work instead maybe if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint,0
this is the worst movie of alltime no doubt and schindlers list did in fact have more laughs this not only tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great sl is considering its heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh i wish i could meet yahoo serious so i could personally throttle him for this and all the other very very very bad movies hes ever been in there is also very few things to say about australia seeing as they like this stupid fruit dont get me wrong people mel gibson from australia are great they brought us mad max it makes me very nauseous that people like this garbage a review i just read said it was very funny sickening isnt it i personally will be boycotting this movie and will start a petition online to ban and burn all yahoo serious movies for being so and i emphasize this so retarded  these are just my personal thoughts no doubting they are shared by everybody who has seen this movie  note if you are forced to watch this movie clockwork orange style call me to commit euthanasia on you for free,0
how on earth can people give this movie a low rating unbelievable the performances of wilkinson and watson are so full of merit that i can only imagine that these detractors were weaned on blockbusters and porn if this sounds badtempered its because i just wiped my original 400worder just now i was so impressed by tom wilkinson all hail the guy this is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill his development as an actor from the full monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing one of the best things to happen in filmmaking in the last ten years  emily watson is somewhat less commanding due to that glint in her eye that says see me this cheeky woman here you cant guess what im going to do next because i dont know either it seems to be something she cant help showing us in every role but still shes an actor of terrific ability and presence she is very sexy here as she needs to be and fair play to her for this this is a screen quality that normally for me she doesnt have in previous films  as you might expect rupert everett required to play an upperclass late30 something who could give tutorials at phd level in how not to give a toss about heading to hell on account of total selfishness delivers he is so thin here throughout the movie however im worried for him linda bassetts housekeeper is also excellent a smallish role but with a major plot twist to deliver she makes you ponder how much talent we have in britain in terms of character acting i want to see more of her  the narrative arc is fine its an interesting enough plot given that noone in filmmaking seems to be trying to convince joe public that theres nothing new under the sun though it does stray towards 40s melodrama in the last reel but never mind that  this is a terrific 80 minutes worth of anyone who has halfabrains money congrats to julian fellowes on his first directorial effort o how we need more films of substance like this he shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel telling a story with much effectiveness and subtlety and congrats too on conjuring an immense display of the film actors art from mr tom wilkinson what a geezer  t,1
this film is one of my favorite christmas classics sure its fluff its not relevant but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing no this movie is definitely a good thing as martha stewartappropriatelywould say barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her both of them have charm and warmth to spare they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40s and 50ssydney greenstreet szcuddlessakall reginald gardiner and una oconnor among them where are characters like this today not one role could have been better cast bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film stanwyck was a strong actress but had the wisdom to play this lightly she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect morgan is the essence of the nice guy because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself but he too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones skip the ill advisedand pointless1992 remake and watch this bright sparkling holiday gift,1
honestly this may be the worst movie ive ever seen and ive seen spider baby and not of this earth heck ive even seen 200 motels having just discovered the freaks and geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda cardellini i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb i didnt realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio   this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state seriously   watch this movie if you think will farrel is really really really funny if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius watch this movie but please dont breed,0
dont torture a duckling is one of fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films  and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for  this is still a very unique and enjoyable film  the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations  either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both  include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protg a mentally handicapped townsman and a deafmute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed  dont torture a duckling is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both  it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulcis later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulcis nonsplatter films  but dont despair dont torture still has more than its fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting  but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one a look 8510,1
i really liked this quirky movie the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv it has a realistic edge with a captivating story line the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch,0
i first saw this masterpiece on vhs 10 years ago and the powerful interpretation on angrykidpainfullyagainstestablishedsociety it carried stayed in my heart since then director hector babenco is such a good humanity who finds a delicate angle to tell the story of how urbanity kills the childhood of the kids from poverty class even the outcast kids have their innocent beautiful dreams but the corrupt reality never gives a chance  thanks to the publishers for the recent dvd release i now can keep this great movie to my favorite collection,1
the regard of flight and the clown bagatelles as performed by bill irwin are some of the funniest both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags performances ive ever seen my father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since we quote it back and forth fairly constantly its a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase i have a bad vhs copy that i acquired from a specialty distributer a few years ago but mr irwins performance deserves a proper dvd treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performersproducers as well as more examples of modern clowning  bill irwins talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances i share the regard of flight with friends quite often and though i am always greeted with a small amount of skepticism when i mention that it is a mixture of clowning and vaudeville i have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it in case the powers that be ever happen upon this imdb listing please consider releasing this and other bill irwin work,1
deep water examines the pressures and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary the testimony and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late 1960s and a groundbreaking round the world yacht race the personal conflicts of duty to family self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films i have seen i was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed the story is mostly respectful to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than ruthlessly exposed most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters this movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense joy and drama,1
this is so overly clichd youll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes the beginning is very interesting with a fair going on and someone gets killed this movie would have been better set on this setting  so jill johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend issues i dont see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story  since jill has come home late her father sends her to babysit for the mandrakiss in their glamorous home in a deserted lake the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning another empty house to the side for their son whos at college ok  after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself she gets a couple of hang ups ooh scary ones to which her friend comes to the rescue to come up with a couple of high school lines about love and whatever friend leaves and goes to her car to which then she drops her keys uhhhthen the music dumdumdum she fumbles to pick them up and gets into her car which of course doesnt start how clichd is that soshe disappears d jill alone again uh most of this movie is with her by herself so theres not much dialog so more hangups she calls the police who say they cant help her but call back if she has any more problems  so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling or her boyfriends friends are calling they have been but only once like thats supposed to be scary much oh and did i mention her friend just now comes on caller id and some creepy man voice comes on she gets all freaked out and shyt  yeah so skip that she sees the light in the house of the mandrakiss son go on so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in bleheh  ah its so boring i cant continue,0
i would have to say this is a great movie   mike judge has an eye forseeing things that nobody would ever notice hence office space hemakes a statement about the dumbing down of society and that survival of the fittest is mere pipe dream in 500 years that pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day yes there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to get the story moving and his point across but the genuine frustration on private joe bowers face is priceless and some cases we can all relate to it at some point in our lives   if you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again it took me watching it twice to really appreciate this film for what it isand with said after watching it twicei am going to read a book now,1
in  out in my opinion is a very hilarious movie i thought that cameron matt dillon was wrong to say that howard kevin kline was gay the part i liked most was howards bachelor party this was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things including barbra streisand films i also thought that emily joan cusack looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that howard looked good in his tuxedo my favorite quote of in  out is is everybody gay is this the twilight zone that was absolutely hilarious the one character i couldnt stand was sonya shalom harlow this was because she was very conceited and snobby in conclusion i recommend this movie to all you kevin kline fans who have not seen it be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it,1
i have to say that this movie was really quite awful the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematographyi found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the clich lines did nothing for me the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and didnt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary the ending wasnt satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didnt make me feel anything for the characters this movie was boring and did nothing for me i recommend this movie to no one,0
it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie  imagine king kong being recast as an organ grinders monkey and fay wrays part being played by a young boy how about elton john as rambothis movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter  by using the title watchers and dean koontzs name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book  read the book i have never talked to anyone who didnt like it another good book is the winner by david baldachi,0
id give this film a 110 this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current skin trend in bollywood movies id definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie what really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like yash chopra films ever succumb to such an awful production they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than adult audience too which when exposed to these sort of gross moviesmay wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition  on the whole films must not only be entertaining but also must comprise of some sense as well certainly this film is an immense disappointment to yash chopra fans especially me myself i am really disappointed over the plot acting and everything else why cant people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films at least for once throughout the film the point is clear id like to put my opinion in short horrible  disappointment  lot of adult material  lack of sensible substance  lack of normal psyche  worthless  could grab a cornetto or a temptations chocolate instead,0
yes i couldnt stop yawning nor could my partner incredibly boring  90 minutes seemed to stretch to at least 3 hours  and im not even a fan of action films but this just falls asleep on its feet  unless you are a 70s polo neck sweater fan    some spoilers follow  if you were expecting anything to happen dont hold your breath  it doesnt   but seriously it totally fails to convince or involve the watcher its like a long boring and rather disjointed dream frederic floats through it able to leave work whenever he wants and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and messages constantly obviously not real life and an office with virtually no paper or files  just a giant calendar to let you know that the film really is taking 6 months to watch   frederick never seems to be touched by any real emotion neither does his wife and the children behave like rag dolls  in stark contrast to any real life even chloe despite her strong views never gives the appearance of really feeling anything the only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a couple overseen in a cafe and have nothing to do with the plot  okay so maybe there are some moral considerations but if its entertainment or even good cinematography you are looking for i think this film is incredibly overrated by most other viewers,0
this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl this young man has ever seen tiffaniamber thiessan is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic tiffani completes this movie which contains funny scenes put on by shore,1
first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not a werewolf movie this title is bullcrap the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and i guess it actually works because thats the reason why i bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isnt any good actually its bloody awful but i didnt expect anything else when i bought it its a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie is really baaaaaaad  this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say its so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody its like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo shes the worst of them all i have never seen an actor as bad as her and ive seen pteradactyl even when her boyfriend dies she cant stop being a bimbo about it i hate her  some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but thats the way i like it the chupacabra looks pretty messed up and its easy to see that its a guy in suit  overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and its very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer,0
its difficult to criticize a movie with the title like deathbed the bed that eats and involves a ghost narrator whos trapped behind a 2way painting he drew and a bed that snores and  if im not mistaken masturbates now thats getting back at its human companions furthermore it foams up in orange for whatever reason to absorb edibles lying on its surface including apples wine fried chicken and of course people again its suffice to say that dont expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange suds takes  dissolving only certain things itll drink the wine but the bottles okay and itll eat away at the chicken bone but the buckets just fine heck the bed even replaces the unused containers hilariously at one point it downs peptobismol i had to laugh at that one i dont think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously its low budget and its extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money i thought in a world where there can be a killer lift and a blood beach this deathbed might be amusing to watch for reasons that might involve cost 90 of the film is voiceover no one screams or shows extremely low signs of frightconfusion on why a bed would attack i can think of one  and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed and youll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief a victim loses all flesh on his hands barely saying ow only one scene that went on too long was minutely tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back using a sheet where are the mst3k guys,0
i have to say this this is the first movie im reviewing on here i didnt finish watching i mean i couldnt continue no matter how adamant i am for watching things until the bitter end the ballad of the sad caf proved no match to this viewer vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on anyways a long lost relative comes to visit hes a midget and well thats as far as i got what the heck was the point of all of this i didnt even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on as i was already pummeled senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role i call this coffee table cinema the type of cinema that appeals to just a scant few of you but the others just stay away,0
i wont spoil it for you although you probably could care less if it was spoiled youll know what i mean after you watch it poor story brated movie quality typical horror stupid situations rare timing i should of known when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add quotes just tells me that the movie bombed big time and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner but i kept getting let down i dont usually waste my time adding comments to any movie in fact this is my second post i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it,0
rarely have i seen an actionsuspense movie that was so boring none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad charlie sheen platoon major league stars as the white house chief of staff who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead donald sutherland a time to kill fallen plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton linda hamilton terminator dantes peak plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation charlie sheen is ok as the star donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance linda hamilton gives a poor performance with a bad movie i can actually like it if it has a good ending but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff,0
for those of you who have never heard of the movie until now of which i presume there are many lucky people who havent ill summarise it for you ryan gosling plays the titular character of leland who also serves as the films narrator a la kevin spacey in american beauty but without the intelligent observations on life leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded kid to death and the movie attempts to figure out why he did it he seems to be a nice boy if not mentally absent and is portrayed by gosling with a complete lack of violence anger or agenda and if youre waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie dont waste your time its not that kind of movie once in juvenile prison leland goes to classes taught by pearl madison ably portrayed by don cheadle who is incapable of anything but quality even when in bad movies pearl attempts to unlock the mystery of leland in an attempt to figure out how such a kid could do such a thing and so he could write a book about it later along with being a juvenile prison teacher pearl is also an aspiring author  the relationship between leland and pearl is the driving narrative behind the film as their talks unveil lelands past to the audience however to call it the central focus would imply that this meandering film had one it does not the united states of leland boasts an impressive cast which seems to be to the detriment of the film it seems as though writerdirector matthew ryan hodge dont worry that you havent heard of him hes never done anything had to give every character a personal story arc and personality flaw in order to get the actors to play them most of these traits and stories are clichd and most go underdeveloped and unresolved  ill try and break them down here martin donovan and ann magnuson are the parents of the slain retarded boy i love how the movie kept calling the kid retarded never mentally disabled that part made me laugh inside they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema must be cold their other two kids are michelle williams who is apparently an aspiring actress about to attend college and jena malone who plays the same troubled teenarchetype she always plays this time with a heroine addiction malone was also the girlfriend of leland which gives him his link to his victim williams boyfriend who was orphaned and came to live with the family and is a baseball player looking to go to the same college as his girlfriend is played by chris klein he ends up doing more with his character than any of the other bit players managing to steal the movie at times lena olin is lelands mother who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason kevin spacey also the executive producer is lelands cold and absentee father who is a famed novelist eventually sherilyn fenn will show up to put a wrinkle in lelands story if you even care at that point oh yeah and theres a drugdealing exboyfriend a couple of fellow juvees and a coworker of pearls with whom he has an affair on his long distance girlfriend with played by kerry washington  sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long if it seemed meaningless and boring then youve just experienced a bit of what i did during the 108 minutes i spent watching the movie but the unruly supporting cast of overwrought clichs is the least of this films crimes the biggest one is that the whole exercise is entirely pointless we arent given a fascinating look into a troubled mind we arent given an effective explanation we arent given much of anything given that it sucked so much im gonna go ahead and spoil the ending for you so that you never have to see it leland stabbed the retard because all leland could see in the world was sadness and wanted to spare corky or whatever the victims name was the sadness in his eyes its like the worst emo band in the world made an album and titled it the world is sad so i killed a retard oh and leland dies in the end in a sequence so reliant of unbelievable coincidences that it would have ruined the movie if the movie didnt already suck of course he dies in the end because that made the movie so deep  im giving the movie 2 stars because the actors themselves all did a pretty good job with the junk they were given the scenes with cheadle and gosling together were even interesting on some levels but to paraphrase the film itself you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts kiddo,0
the dog can actunfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux childrens film can a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children much to the chagrin of their bitter and coldhearted father in what can only be described as dickensian the evil widower forbids his children  who may or may not be mentally challenged  from playing with benji neither the children nor benji obeys soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them its only then that the old man realizes that benji is good not bad  tom lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dimwitted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers so does the regrettably overutilized deborah walley walleys previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful its a bikini world she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her goodgirl reputation by playing it bad   stay away from benjihes a dog and this movie is a dog,0
the animatrix a detective story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it carrieanne moss plays trinity in this animated cartoon i really like the private detective ideas created by the director,1
this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell  and did so really awful jumble of unlikelyunexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line all without character or clear motivation  we get clich snapshots instead of characters one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss who projects an overdone tough guy persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase as in the smallest from a complete american tourister set in a bright sky blue without explanation or apology otherwise its standard visually  one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in ct,0
the standard bearer of all movie serials the definite good guy  flash gordon  versus bad guy  ming the merciless though the special effects seem awful by todays standards for 1936 they were top notch but the essence of the story is the battle between earthman flash gordon buster crabbe versus emporer ming of mongo charles middleton crabbe and middleton are terrific in their parts and the supporting characters playing dale arden dr zarkov princess aura prince barin vulcan and the rest are all very good this serial is far superior to the 1980 movie basically because crabbe is much much superior to sam j jones as flash gordon  this serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials no question about it,1
ok about 11 years ago the awesome funny movie the mask came out and everyone loved it and now 11 years later the mask is brought back in this awesome movie right wrong this movie was the stupidest movie that i have probably ever seen i mean when i rented it i thought that i would be laughing so hard that i would almost pee my pants like from the first one but after i saw this sequal i barley even let out a chuckle i mean no offense to the director or the cast of this movie but what a waste of time and money so the plot of the whole story was about this little baby that has part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for some thing because that is all i really got i would have least added some more things to it so it would be higher than a 2 out of 10 stars,0
this film did not excite me while on vacation in turkey i noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it the action sequences in the film are well choreographed however the story drags during the middle of the film  one thing that i did not quite follow is how borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards  the other thing that i did not particularly like was the missing segment of khans life it did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and reimprison him after he had gone missing for so long   overall i rate this movie a 4 because i enjoyed the action sequences but they were too few to justify a higher rating as the dialog left me less than impressed,0
there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call good the acting was dull and sedated the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a starbucks and tried to make the perfect gap commercial characters have no drive motivation or reason for us to care about them theres such a lack of interest and tension that its hard to follow the banal action and dialog and the plot if anyone finds it im sure it would be as boring as everything else  this isnt funny its not romantic it doesnt reflect on the human condition if you want a good stoner comedy watch halfbaked if you want a good stoner drama watch trainspotting the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of one is because its kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the midlate 90s cast which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star but then again this is a shallow movie,0
this trash version of romeo and juliet passes in manhattan in the present days romeo will keenan is an ahole and violent member of family que and juliet jane jensen is a sexy with beautiful legs and breasts and bisexual girl of capulet family the scatological situations this romantic pair will face are very funny although being a cult movie inclusive exhibited in rio de janeiro festival it is not recommended for all the audiences if the viewer is fan of peter jacksons former movies braindead bad taste toxic avenger body melt and other trash movie he will certainly love this flick otherwise he will hate it since i belong to the first group my vote is eight,1
a good story wellacted with unexpected character twists eg vicious murderous gangster bryan brown teaching his son macrame although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy ledger and his gilrfriend succeed it also has some hilarious ironic black humour eg the bank robbers who become radio competition winners and their reaction the buskers revenge etc well worth watching,1
ok so i gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really coollittle did i know that the only cool thing about this clichdriven turd was precisely its trailer  at the cinema i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself no way this movie is so bad dont be an idiot give it a chance youve only seen 3 minutes while i rolled my eyes in shame all those frames showedget thisa guy with a poker face because he feels nothingthats deep looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame in the second or third one he stays awake in his perfectly made bed because he sleeps like a dead guycause he feels nothing and his father calls and says john garden state is me your fatheroh come on ive seen a little more than a couple flicks to hate clichs such as the is me your insert parent how the hell am i supposed to react oh he has a tough relationship with himuhyeah thats exactly how im supposed to react  man this is a crappy movie  anywho as the flick goes on we learn things about his friends of which everyone is a alternative emo walking indie movie clich for example one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant who speaks klingon bizarre characters  pop culture  your standard american indie flick then we know natalie portmans character who is a copy of alissa jones from a movie that kicks gss butt chasing amy amelie and that chick from eternal sunshine you know smart original not really cultured beautiful andin touch with her sexuality  she listens some 70s band named the shins and giveswhat theyre from this damn decade then why do they sound like that oh they have no personality okso she hands her cd player to john garden state and he looks at her with a dumb faceyou know love as the song played on i heard its lyrics saying you will love this soundtrack it is so alternative and cool you will love this movie it will define you and your generation even if it is a ideological photocopy of the breakfast club ghost world and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years you will drink coffee and read books you dont understand  by now really unoriginal sht starts to happenhe doesnt care if he dies in a airplane crash because he is already deadand he feels nothing and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called fight club it is a cool scene but oh did i mentioned it appeared in the trailerthen in some party and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he makes out with a bimboso oh hes not such a emotional zombie after allclever character development or just a shtty moviewell lets analyze that scene it features him sitting motionless in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speedscene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called requiem from a dreamso just a shtty shtty movie  then they meet more eccentric clich actually characters and finally one that lives next to a big hole in the ground john garden state says some crap like good luck exploring your infinite abyss and the guy saysand by now i wanted to really choke myself you tooand then we are gently told that neo is jesusoh no wait thats from another dumb obvious repetitive overestimated and clich piece of crap  finally finally some more crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs he has to talk to his dad who he hasnt seen in the last zillion years cause he finally cool spoilers killed his own momyou see he killed his mom so hes also deadand feels nothingthats deep now i really expected just clever and moving magnolialike dialogue between a father and a sonbut this is garden state so this is pretty much it john garden state father i forgive you you didnt know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years but i know you love me crappy directors dad no no im gonna say some simple stuff cause im not really so deep of a character anyway like this whole movie actually so no john garden state no dad we must get along cause we are equal individualsi mean different individuals crappy directors dad no nook you convinced me   and he gets the girl cause hes no longer dead you know and the movie ends and i go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day  this madefortrailer movie sucks,0
this is one of those rare comedies where try as you might you cant help but giggle chortle guffaw and yes even laugh out loud the lead actors performance as hyde is pure manic genius see if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation good luck  on the downside there are times when the movie does bog down it seemed longer than its 90 minutes,1
this is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor we follow michael ealy as the undercover fbi agent darwyn set to infiltrate a terror cell lead by farik oder fehr the series is very well written and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next  michael ealy is by my definition one of the best actors ive seen portraying an undercover agent icey cold on the outside but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional rollercoaster ride that fbi has had him embark on oder fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario big and strong but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed highly authoritative and extremely cunning the way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular  the way the story develops and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable and also very true to life i would imagine it is of such magnitude that youre left with the feeling of being insecure not knowing what might happen next in real life we read about terror every day and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about  its a series that will for sure have you coming back for more sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on its a sure winner in my eyes and i have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best,1
i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed  it is essentially a mysterythriller where this girl who cant remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool  i really liked the setting of this one a desolate postmodern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity  surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of its time  8 out of 10 kids,1
as long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy and not intended as a serious release it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is i even liked the theme music  and if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by joel or mike and the mst3k bots this is it watch this with a bunch of smartass wisecrackers and youre in for a good time have a brew butter up some large pretzels and enjoy  of course obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware but if youre here on the imdb then youre most likely savvy enough to do so good luck  and look for my favorite partwhere dr doom informs the ff that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishesand he actually gestures the number 12 with his finger while doing soits like evil sesame streethoo boy  and of course mrs storm declaring just look at youthe fanstastic four is just so heartwarmingyoull laugh youll cry  so if you love schlocky scifi this ones fantastic for you,0
lisa grant adrienne barbeau is a real estate agent who finds herself in jeopardy of getting killed by a deranged maniac who kills people in her profession who he feels make house prices too high as motives go this is pretty damn retarded lisas boyfriend happens to be a talk show host whom the killer keeps calling onair at first i was positive this was supposed to be a comedy or satire of some kind but as the endless minutes drone on and on i realized that it wasnt and the film was just grossly incompetent in every way shape and form im just surprised that something this horrid wasnt directed by jeff lieberman yea email me some hate mail again jeff you hack anyway back to the film poor poor barbeau you can pinpoint exactly when her film career went down in flames and it all started here  my grade f   where i saw it the movie channel,0
it seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the silvery screen disgorged such unutterable tripe as this and many other adventure movies i am reminded of the similarly lavish but equally wretched ashanti outlined elsewhere  whatever motivated alist actors to signon for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer they must have been very very desperate to be perfectly candid roger moores appearance in any movie is the kiss of death although extremely handsome in his youth his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow every emotion from a to b is conveyed by this simple stratagem his were the dogdays of james bond lee marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings perhaps most memorably paint your wagon and the dirty dozen he has a comic streak but he is much better when he plays it straight  the excellent ian holm is a throwaway hardly recognisable blackedup as a mute african everyone else just turned up for their paycheques  the only plausible and watchable element is the german cruiser it looks like a very large model but it is believably massive and appears authentic  as do its crew the rest isnt even hokum the childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of lee marvins gin here is a director who simply doesnt know where hes going there are hints of the african queen a snatch from the pride  the passion gold and one or two other ripoffs from movies whos titles dont come readily to mind  strangely i have seen it 3 times each occasion it has been shown on television when i have been laid low with a cold or the flu perhaps that is influencing my judgement  but not much  compare it with any indiana jones movie and you will see what i mean  i have given it two stars one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that  time for another lemsip i think,0
midnight clear has a great premise a group of overeducated overly bright gis are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the battle of the bulge the gis encounter a group of battleweary german regulars and it becomes clear that they dont want to fight anymore  therein lies the problem its really pretty simple if the germans want to surrender they do so and thats the end of the movie if the germans want to fight they do so and thats also the end of the movie so instead of doing either the gis and germans play games with each other even throwing snowballs at one point interesting for one or two scenes but it soon becomes very annoying after all these are germans the enemy nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot the film does noting to make them more human in fact much of what the german characters did made me want to shoot them including one scene where the german officer refuses to deal with a jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man why should i care about such characters just shoot them and lets move on to the battle of the bulge its much more interesting anyway  one good scene the gis are returning from a recon of the german position where they had the germans in their sights but did not fire while walking across a clearing they realize a group of germans have their mausers leveled at them the germans are about 100 yards away the gis then do something ive never seen any gis do in any sillywood movie they throw down their rifles and throw up their hands unusual as this may be in films it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance though it seems far in reality its pointblank range for those rifles ill lay odds that someone working on this film was a cruffler,0
possible  spoilers included but nothing critical given away  i just watched this classic low budget movie on video and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen all the actors do themselves proud especially john daniels must see another of his films not only does this movie boast great performances but manages stylish sequences like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man i love the way slowmotion photography was used in 70s cinema dreamy and hypnotic cool and witty black dudes spout great one liners while slimy seedy lumps of white trash come to unpleasant ends i love it my rating 10  10 if this ever comes out on dvd count me in for a purchase,1
i chose this movie really for my husbandwho works in radio broadcasting i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too though it was from the eightiesso it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to strangle the host barry at times you just want to send some of the bigots who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he has truly gotten too big for his jeans if you know what i mean it was on the drama channel on encoreso i am thinking this is a true story if you truly love dramas you will love this even if you dont know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him you shouldnt his part is really a bit part in this movie,1
this film is about a young indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman the problem is that he is gay in order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control  this film is hilarious and got me laughing many times sally bankes acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly the plot is outstanding as well i find the plot very realistic and i can completely identify with jimis feeling of being terrified worried and upset on the other hand jimis boyfriend jack is given much less attention in the film i would have liked him to be given more lines in the film and have more character development however as i guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film the love between jimi and jack was not developed in the film  it is great to watch a gay affirmative film furthermore this film preaches us to be accepting to other peoples difference be it sexuality culture and the way of life this film makes viewers think hard  we need films like this to give us a boost thanks for making this film,1
many movies try to take universal themes and make a comedy but few will rise to the occasion like checking out the movie is brilliant the dialogue is well written and true to form the acting is absolutely prima peter falk has given a truly great performance  as an actor as an actor he is able to carry the cast to greatness another great performance is given by laura san giacomo she is such an intriguing actress her performances take one by surprise she delivers no matter what role she is asked to give  from wacko in stephen kings the stand to her television performances however checking out allows her to shine it is a role she is meant to play the film is brilliantly directed by jeff hare he was able to bring out the best in his cast and his direction  in every aspect  made the film a wonderful treasure jeff hare was able to make a difficult theme laughable and yet profound he gives us an up close and personal look at why indie films need to be made the directors knowledge of his cast and script are extended to the finished film the results are superb  hopefully it will be made available to large audiences because this is one you wont want to miss it has the potential of being the sleeper hit of 2005  in the fashion of my big fat greek wedding,1
what an utter disappointment forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane all the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons peter cook is good as the british pm it lacks the biting satire of the original going instead for lowest common denominator slapstick 1 out of 10 if im being generous this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people,0
its the best movie i have ever seen i just love them i watch it every day i have the episodes from the internet here in romania is being broadcast the 6 season im happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and im glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season until now season 5 is my favorite one d i love it because logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite i have liked dean too but logan is best i would like lorelai to remain with christopher because he is beautiful this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen i really want the dvds but i think that here in romania will never appear because i think that they dont even know that they have fans here but no matter what ill be watching it bye,1
you have to acknowledge ciminos contribution to cinema he gave us both the most overrated film in history the deer hunter and the worst film in history heavens gate and before you start with the its bad but not the worst ever let me explain   for 20 years i listened to the critics and avoided heavens gateactually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film then a few days after seeing the final cut the making and unmaking of heavens gate documentary i stumbled on a used 999 dvd of the long version my advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film you will find a wide selection and imagine that the reviewer is ciminos devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear sons movie then you will have an idea of just how big a mess cimino made  while pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever and a classic less than zero example is its shameless distortion of history although the cattlemens association did send a group of regulatorsgunmen to johnson county and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated on the morning of april 9 1892 nick ray and nate champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and texas hired guns who had come to johnson county to clean out rustlers the citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested or rescued by the army women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from ray and champion there were minimal casualties after all these were sieges not assaultsand there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the indians and weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of johnson county residents were hanged without trial including jim averell the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife ella watson who cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows averell living to a ripe old age   there is no moviemaking sin greater than fictionalizing history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal perhaps it is harsh to blame cimino for his distortion of history he could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defensethe film provides plenty of support if cimino was insane during the production of heavens gate it would explain a lot of things but my vote goes to lack of directing talent instead of insanity  there are some good things about heavens gate you can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went expensive setsbeautiful epic camera shotsartful dance sequences isabelle huppert a strange casting choice that actually worked gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters the dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary  but dont fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageantlike explosions of communal action this implies that there was a method to cimino madness experiments is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible the simple fact is that there is no evidence cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization what it looks like is that he just turned his dp loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots15 million feet of loosely staged scenes then he tried without success to pare this down and fit everything together in postproduction   the final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen perhaps borrowed from a fiddler on the roof touring company throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly after you see this happen 5060 times you can relate to the woman the one who looks like something out of the grapes of wrath who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger this is probably what ciminos mother did after writing that review  so believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980 it is a sloppy disconnected poorly paced and historically distorted mess of value only as a how not to make a film example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the american west,0
first of all let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like id been sold a bill of goods mind you its not the movies fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second although i dont know how thats enteredmaybe some moron from the films crew put it in being a fan of the horrorcomedy genre i checked it out based on that and im so so sorry i did where to start first of all to touch back on my beginning theres no comedy in this movie it tries once or twice but never gets more than a chuckle at best my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny also theres no horror here not a second of tension can be found you think im exaggeratingi am not no tension very little blood and not much violence on screen sorry but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul helltheres even zero nudity call me a purist or juvenilei prefer some in a horror flick if it cant come up with an original plotpremise and that tired as all hell reality tv show gone wrong thing its been done before and a lot better like wrong turn 2 orummmwhatever that movie was called with edward furlong thats how bad this movie is i dont even remember the name of that movie but it was better than this i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because reality tv is taking over did someone from the past post that with a time machine are you freaking kidding me this thing is trashand not in a fun way,0
it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened   the square is peopled by such a miserable untrustworthy amoral spiteful unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined everyone is stabbing someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being stabbed cuckolded or swindled nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day its hell with cockney accents  i suspect this programme must be sponsored by the samaritans its perfect viewing for the depressed it doesnt cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sadarses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse  they might be living in albert square  apart from the above as a representation of londons east end it is pure hokum the programmemakers have evidently never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a colossal mosque and this prettywell defines the racial majority of the population white british londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority a large advertisement hoarding presently near the bow road flyover and sponsored by tower hamlets health care boasts that eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly ten healthy smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation eight of them are darkskinned   whats more i used to work with a bunch of anglosaxon  dare i say pukka  cockneys a few years ago and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience ive never had each day was like an oswald moseley rally they couldnt pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene fackin pakis and fackin maceroons were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of adjectives fixated upon sexorgans and their application alf garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison  any programme that purported to represent londons native eastend caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast  even after the 9 oclock watershed imagine a ku klux klan script written by quentin tarantino and youd be somewhere near the mark but when they werent being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful  i dont know how such a soapopera came to be this imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if youre of a comparatively sanguine disposition it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronicdepressives with cockney accents  whats the point of that  dull dreary unrelentingly disillusional and ethnically preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation  avoid it like the plague,0
i have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore the timeless music the tender voices of william holden and jennifer jones leave this grown man weeping through joyous romantic scenes and im not one who cries very often in life where have our william holdens gone and will they make these moving wonderful movies any more its sad to have to realize that they probably wont but dont think about it just try to block that out of your mind even so they wont have holden in it and he wont appear on that hill just once more either you can only enjoy this film and watch it again,1

korean romance about the owner of a camera store who is diagnosed with a fatal disease as he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer a friendship and romance grows eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other good film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in america simply because the studios would insist that the couple act on their feelings he will not say anything because he doesnt have that long to live she wont because its not the thing thats done and he is not responding as she thinks he should of course its much more complex than im making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should discover for yourself is it a great film no but it is a good one that will move you emotionally the final lines of the film still haunts me i always knew that love would fade like a photograph  but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment thank you and goodbye it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving,1
clifton webb as mr scoutmaster is one of the alltime greats for comedy and remembering an innocence now diminished in the world i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie although i have requested it time and again  this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty respect dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis there is so much low selfesteem talked about in present daily lives but this movie among many many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the presentday younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences it certainly appealed to us baby boomer generation of yesterday old lessons are universal and timeless,1
how bad can you make a film a good question which house of the dead 2 succeeds in answering i could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first house of the dead but amazingly the director has succeeded the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad just bad what with overacting bad fx and a stupid story its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to zmovies in general why could they not learn the lesson from the first house of the dead movie anyway i guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film it is but a waste of time watch bad taste or dawn of the dead if you want to see some good zombies,0
this movie packs a punch there are a few every now and then that make me think deeply and disturb me a lot i could see myself in this same predicament  passively allowing things to happen around me not standing up for the right and decent thing just trying to avoid trouble how often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out how often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others we would never join them we tell ourselves we recognize that what they are doing is bad but do we do anything about it   lawrence newman william h macey is a lowkey nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in brooklyn ny in the waning days of world war ii he rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him has never married rarely socializes just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother then a series of events in his very white little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events it starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a puerto rican girl by the son of his neighbor soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision as he is now better able to see he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life the one bright spot is a new love in his life and he marries hoping to continue on in his normalcy then the virulent antisemitism on that street catches him despite his credentials as a presbyterian wasp as things spiral further out of control he discovers he must make an important decision  does he take a stand or does he simply go away  i cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for post war antisemitism is the setting here but there is injustice at all times and in all places it is for the individual to decide where he or she stands,1
after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down however after i got my region 1 dvd  the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas i was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get bogged down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater i recommend this movie to one and all,1
i actually enjoyed tycus if not for much more than mocking the production values dennis hopper was just fine although i wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used and furthermore what was with the scene with the ninja that was just completely out of pace perhaps someone came up with the bright idea midshooting oh well this movie is great if youre drunk and need a good laugh cheers,0
a cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a caribbean islandto get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous results  lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suitthe cgi scenes looked like a different movie ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b movie  the best thing was john rhysdavieshis daughter the eye candy a close secondjohn was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say he said it wellgood job given what he had to work withthe cyptozoologist was over the top and fun to watch toohe had some funny bitsthe marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and gueststhere are a few pretty funny lines in this movieand a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thief  the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie i did like the gore of the legless manreally since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this movie  all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit,0
larry bishop the writeractordirector focuses too heavily on the camera music and visuals the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience the actors experience a bumpy ride from the films start to finish and are caught in one terrible smoke screen the hell with the ride the film is a bomb  the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness they are bikers antiheroes and protagonists pistolero played by larry bishop is the revengeful leader of the pack the gent michael madsen is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis   comanche eric balfour is loyal but mysterious deuce performed by david carradine should have passed on the ride and so should the ticketbuyers if you decide to see the film youll be sorry but youll find out why billy wings vinnie jones is a lewd and venomous character completely filled with disdain  what puzzles me is how this film with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere ticketbuyers take my advice dont pay for the ride please dont make the same mistake as the investors  the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is confusing and unintelligible the dialog which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues doesnt make any sense the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess he too should have passed on the ride there are decapitated heads slashed throats and nude females wrestling it is clear that bishop doesnt know where he is going with the film he gets entirely lost but by the end of the ride you just wont give a damn mama mia stay home and by all means dont take the ride i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero,0
apparently in the eyes of some  there arent enough horror films these days involving young people being chased across a desert by a mysterious bloodthirsty madman in a truck i mean all we have so far is joy ride wolf creek jeepers creepers monster man  among others rest stop may very well be the worst out of those it is about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in california along the way they stop at a grimy lavatory so the young lady can relieve herself but when she returns  she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone from there she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup who proceeds to stalk and terrorize her as she hides in the restrooms this movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring the acting is annoying the gore is mild and the killer whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire movie is anything but memorable terrible  terrible film,0
i am a fan of jess francos bizarre style and a lover even of his trashier films and my personal opinion is that he has besides several very entertaining movies also created a few masterpieces such as the brilliant paroxismus aka venus in furs of 1969 for example it is however an undeniable fact that the 180 movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career also include a bunch of big time stinkers sadomania of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity  sure the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time the only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is generously spoken slightly amusing  after couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns wardens of a local prison camp while the husband is banished from the island the wife is taken to the prison camp a place of torture and sexual humiliation reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac magda and an extremely perverted governor the prisoners are of course entirely hot chicks most of them blondes the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles  the plot if one can call it that is extremely stupid of course but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway the only interesting thing about sadomania is the high level of exploitation even for a women in prison film there are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality and some of the torture scenes are really nasty  it is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze however can still be so boring the sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning but after the first 45 minutes i actually had a hard time not to fall asleep it also makes me wonder why out of all pornstars jess franco chose ajita wilson who was according to most sources a transsexual who had been born a man well maybe for exactly that reason if you really want to watch this make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor dont expect to be highly entertained however it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring i am a jess franco fan and i always will be but sadomania is just bad 210,0
may contain spoilers in no way shape or form does this movie break the horror movie mold not by a long shot however it does deliver a creepy atmosphere believable enough characters and gore  the story is simple and doesnt bother to unfurl itself anymore than it needs to a bunch of kids are killed in a mining accident back in the early 1900s since then they have stalked and killed the residence of their sleepy little pa town in the mountains  simple they want revenge on the man that caused their death years and years ago naturally his great great great grandson is in town and hes a real prick  along with that a mother and her two daughters inherit a run old house after the husband dies the eldest daughter is rebellious obnoxiousa typical teen the younger is curious brighteyed and gets in with the ghost children  the creepiest part of this flick is the sheer emotionlessness of the children and they hack their way through victim after victim excellent acting it was so spooky i mean the children of the corn flicks are one thingbut this topped any of those as for the creepy kids  worht a look i bought it before seeing it and i was not unhappy but im a horror fan through and through,1
if the directorsproducerspublicists wish to promote a film as based on actual events and make a film that is meant to inspire and have meaning then for a start to maintain any sort of creditability and integrity you would want to keep a film as honest as you possibly can  a team wearing all black jumpers and doing the haka in america is just plain dumb any half intelligent person would know that the all blacks are the national rugby union team of new zealand and their jumpers are all black and the haka is performed by them as a part of a traditional maori dance  having such stupidity in a movie without explanation merely reduces the credibility of the movie to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve  the question is why why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain  i can only conclude that the writers or director or producers have seen it on tv before a international rugby union match and thought wow that would be great in our movie no one will know that it never happened theyre all too dumb to know about nz nd the all blacks this will be great  how would an americian audience react to a movie made in nz about americain grid iron with a team wearing an american indian costumes and war paint doing a native american indian war dance running round in circles shouting oh woo woo woo oh woo woo woo react theyd laugh their heads off  the people that made this movie and the industry that spawned it really should have their heads read for some reason the industry thinks that they can fool all the people all the time  its just dumb,0
everything i can say is that its one of the best documentary movies of the ocean ever seen it impresses immensely by professional filming scenery and idea what ive seen during those 50 minutes cannot be compared to any other visions of the blue planet,1
as a fan of history mythology and fantasy mystic knights show pulled me in from the getgo it has semidecent scripting the costumes are fantastic there are exceptions it has pretty good acting and the heroes and villains all play well off each other  scriptshalf a script is pretty great the other half falls flat but its all mixed together meaning many episodes turn out soso also some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines king conchobar and angus for instance they need to be given something more im not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something actingapart from some over acting by villagers horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on everyone good and bad works well together costumesweaponsthe everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular mystic knight armor that falls short are deirdres and garretts a chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case and wouldnt look as plastic his looks like bunch of snapittogether pieces of brown plastic when it should look bronze ivars trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and while garretts weapons look cool they also look plastic  recently mystic knights has taken on too many power rangers traits if you watch the show youll know what i mean as the series progresses though it should find its niche and perfect its style overall it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy most of my friends and i watch it and were all 20 the plot thickens and twists though it gets a bit juvenile in places and everything just keeps getting more interesting it might be of some interest to fans of the movie willow or the tv series the adventures of sinbad a lot of adventure a dab of mystery a dash of romance a sprinkling of forces at nature check it out my score 710,1
very funny film with some of the best swedish actors its all filmed in black and white with the true 40ish feeling most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from refugees to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh,1
i have never seen a movie so bad its not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game  its so bad i dont even want to talk about it and thats the whole point of this isnt it please dont bother to see this movie nuf said,0
god bless randy quaidhis leachorous cousin eddie in vacation and christmas vacation hilariously stole the show he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a look  i will say that he tries hard in this made for tv sequel but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really gets anywhere quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets including the orginal audrey dana barron are wasted here even european vacations eric idle cannot save the show in a brief cameo  pathetic and sadactually painful to watchchristmas vacation 2 is the worst of the vacation franchise,0
oh good grief  i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought i must watch this movie ripping off snakes on a plane it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too sounds fantastically bad well i was half right  this movie is eyemeltingly bad and sadly not even unintentionally hilarious its just bad even worse it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language mexican or spanish apologies for my ignorance and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on then we have to endure even more terrible acting and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous  lowbudget does not always mean bad but in this case it does what we have here is a movie given no thought a terrible script a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on its very few strengths i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous avoid if you can  see this if you like stagknight the wicker man remake terrible cgi,0
this movie is beyond horrible avoid at all costs i want my hour and 20 minutes back  not funny at all you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once swears spill out of the speakers like a waterfall each one getting more annoying as the last and not contributing to the comedy or plot general comedy  not this movie in general  all in all its a lamea5 watereddown typed out coldish movie  but tremendously awful the movie focuses around two groups of a city poories and richies how obviously dumb is that where the two opposites have snowboard battles with each other story is much like a 4yearolds bed time story without all the swears and stupid jokes  movie  110  because you cant give any lower scores,0
its been 3 months and you know what that meansa new seagal movie seagal has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film each time every movie getting worse and worse hes really amazing i dont really know what to say about tyd first its a piece of crap the story makes no sense at all secondly he uses stunt men in all his fight scenes and last but not least a lot of the footage is taken from other movies it amazes how this guy continues to find work he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that his films are full of plot holes and stunt men why do we continue to buy his movies why do we continue to have hope that maybe just maybe he will make a great movie,0
ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel the ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies but there still cool there are some nice flash backs from ghoulies the first movie jonathan is back once again in this one he wasnt in parts 2 or 3 though the movie is low budget at times but fun to watch youve got tony cox as the dark ghoulie and arturo gil as the light ghoulie the ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys instead of evil like in the first three movies both ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie then youve got the very hot alexandra its a great dark comedy and funny any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching ghoulies 4 the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007 hopefully one day ghoulies iii will be on dvd in the usa id really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too i doubt it will happen though its 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet if there ever is a sequel i hope jim wynorski will make it  i give ghoulies iv a 910,1
after 10 viewings in 20 years i too think this was the crazy gangs best effort on film with more cohesion in the plot than their next best alfs button afloat they were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of royalty until chesney allen retired in the 40s through illhealth he outlived them all by years apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one another  the six wonder boys troupe head for illgethertotellme alaska to dig for the gold that was being found there it seemed a better idea than going to mansfield  because theyd been there when they get to red gulch they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date  they thought that the chips that were in the guilty newspaper theyd read tasted funny but by then it doesnt matter as theyve all fallen in love with snow white and want to help her grandad find his long lost stash of gold baddie bill m mcgrew wants it himself however  the number of verbal and visual puns is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense to brits and expats interested in seeing 30s british bw comedies imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the gold if patter between bud  chesney and the whistle while you work pastiche  even the always getting our man mountie inserts a marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended,1
this movie has been done when hitler  and mussolini who is as well in the movie was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of nazism especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe  charles lindenbergh for example it would be as today a big actor would made a parody of berlusconi or chirac chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and imho a great demonstration he was a courageous man the movie is funny and deep the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated i think this movie is one of the best ever done,1
after an intriguing start this little drama quickly descends into the ranks of sheer mediocrity the start of the movie sees two women heather graham and natasha gregson wagner meet each other while waiting for their boyfriends to get home from their holidays natasha gregson wagner is a lovely looking actress and she plays louise a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an all round entertainer music movies you name it he does it while shes telling the other girl carla heather graham all about her wonderful boyfriend it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between their two male friends are too much and its obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy oh dear enter robert downey jnr the sleazebag that has two girlfriends while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one downey plays the sort of guy that the ladies like but men find repulsively annoying he is basically a mummys boy the worst kind too on the phone ringing mother all the time continually showering his girlfriends with ambitious albeit empty promises etc its enough to make a normal guy sick  the film knowingly rips off superior threeway love triangle films such as jules et jim this film doesnt work though mostly due to the fact that its story is so unbelievable seriously if two women had just found that they were dating the same guythey wouldnt stick around to talk about it another reason why it falls down is that its just so turgid theres no end of possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this movie presents especially with the claustrophobia of setting it all in a small apartment but all the movie does is get lost in masses of dialogue badly written and poorly delivered dialogue that is the film is also massively overacted it just isnt believable that people would act like they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation robert downey jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the film with natural born killers he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances and that is something that this movie could do with the two females arent wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway but downey could definitely have been better utilised overall a waste of time dont bother see jules et jim or natural born killers instead thats my advice,0
this film tries to skewer the studio era in hollywood and the morals of the 1950s guy stone is intended to be a rock hudson type but both the script and actor matt letscher end up channeling a smarmy cruel baritonevoiced version of george hamilton instead which makes for an unpleasant character  guy stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin unlike hudson who was sweetly promiscuous stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet handsome young men who share his bed every few hours  veronica cartwright is jerry stones celibate lesbian manager cartwright is very good but the director doesnt quite know what to do with her the fault lies in the dialogue which is a bit clumsy and the film suffers for it  carrie prestons sally owes more to ellen greene in the little shop of horrors as written prestons sally is good for a laugh but little else newcomer adam greer is lost in this movie he cannot act and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks  like many recent films straightjacket is a dramedy  a comedy film which switches messily to a drama about twothirds of the way through the film and like almost all dramedies straightjacket fails miserably  despite the expensive services of skywalker sound the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired the overuse of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of cues as well  the film really doesnt managed to satirize anything about the 1950s unlike singin in the rain which perfectly captures hollywoods ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films straightjacket doesnt manage to depict hollywood in the 1950s at all well the dialogue sets and behavior of the key characters are nondescript rather than deadon stereotypes of the 1950s hollywood the same can be said for the lampooning of the general mores social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole compare the transformation of guys home to the deadon satire of the 1950s home in little shop of horrors there is no comparison little shop hits the nail on the head while straightjacket doesnt even know there is a nail  motivations too seem haphazard rick foster is supposed to be a principled liberal yet he falls almost immediately for a materialistic schmuck like guy stone rick is fine with guys closeted status for many months but when it comes time to go to italy he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear and even though sally appears to fall in love with freddie during the party this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s not a gay author of the 1950s indeed modern morality suffuses this film  which it shouldnt if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s hollywood  plot holes in this ragtag film also abound saul repeatedly says that hes going to turn freddie stevens over to the feds but never does so  allowing freddie to out guy jerry and sauls plot to in guy never makes any sense nor does sallys sudden decision to take the blame and although guy has admitted he is a homosexual apparently it doesnt matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anyway  unfortunately none of the production values manage to save this film the cinematography by michael pinkey is pedestrian at times the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture especially the scenes in sauls office everything is restricted to medium shots and the film has an incredibly static the editing by chris conlee doesnt do the film any help either long scenes which would benefit from the insertion of closeups or shifts in point of view remain uncut whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy  the film relies heavily on cgi effects of guys home created by visual effect designer thomas dickens but the cgi looks clumsy and hokey and it is very noticeably amateurish  my overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy the plot muddled the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark the satire nonexistent the performances overbroad and off the mark and the comic timing off its almost an amateurish film it is as if someone took a high school production and threw 10 million at it,0
what is it about the french first they apparently like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does second they seem to like edgar allan poes work more than just about anyone else does its got to be the beaudelaire effect  dont get me wrongim a poe fan myself but this trilogy manages to make three of poes belowaverage stories intowell im not sure what theyre made into  toby dammit is a fine fellini film but it has nothing to do with poes story at least in terms of theme its enjoyable on the first viewing terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role however it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead  metzergenstein is a big mess how did vadims films get produced its just awfulnot even up to amateur film school standards depending on the dvd menu you have try to skip it and save your time  william wilson is actually the segment that is most faithful to poes work it does not have much style though even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film it looks like the boys are throwing tissues or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled up into balls   my advice is to skip metzergenstein watch william wilson and then if youre a fellini fan im not keep toby dammit on while you cook dinner or make a snack,0
if you want to truly experience the magic  of don dohler then check out alien factor or maybe fiend but not this alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and its fairly creepy but nightbeast which i guess is sort of an updating of alien factor is just plain dumb actors sleepwalk through their roles especially mr monotone sheriff and the monster is some dumb halloweenmask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative but kind of stupid looking critters from alien factor a spaceship crashes on earth and theres a critter inside of course who runs around vaporizing people and ripping off arms etc and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too until it gets shot out of his hand and thats really about it alien factor beats this mess hands down if you really want to see a good don dohler movie check that out instead and rip don dohler 12206,0
completely worth checking out saw it on mlks birthday 2006 and it hit me big time sometimes it feels like were all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out just keep on going dont mean to be a downer because thats not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves what happens when we keep being told by the best people like mlk what needs to happen to pull us out of our dead end road but we dont listen i know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are just keep going i guess this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do thats what i consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything something that gets you thinking and keyed up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless,1
i love this film it was made just before the la punk scene changed for the worse it perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place i feel really lucky to have been present at the filming of four of the bands at the fleetwood that night the only part that doesnt fit in too well is the sections with catholic disipline and their sociopolitical commentary i didnt see too many people who were into that at all the rest of the film shows attitudes that i witnessed a lot people dealing with hard lives or taking a swing at the music industry andor lousy hippies i dont think ive seen a documentary that captures so authentically and personally the subject matter being covered,1
the people of my generation and those who are older know about the ww ii or as it is called in russia  the great patriotic war not only from the school textbooks but from the witnesses and participants of the event my granddad was a soldier at stalingrad and when i was a small girl i used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the germans he also told me some anecdotes not all he told me was gloomy but it was long ago and no when i have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of stalingrad i have to turn to books and movies for information somehow most films i saw were made in the soviet union only a few in present day russia and stalingrad is an exception in the movie the war is described from the opposite side and the fact in itself is interesting all that is shown in the film is quite different from what im used to  the film reminds me a great deal of remarques zeit zu leben und zeit zu sterben because the war is shown through an ordinary german soldier perception and this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist the movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic europe from the italian coast arrive in the snowcovered hungry soviet union they are doomed to die it is clear from the very beginning  after the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at stalingrad one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me he said if you start thinking you will go mad and to my mind it is true for spectators as well from the one hand one may think ok ill just watch this movie and it wont dissipate me i neednt feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa however sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing kolyas execution  stalingrad is hard to watch all these frostbitten legs dirt executions snow famine destroyed illusions  as far as i know lt hans von witzland is one of the few films where thomas kretschmann played his star roles i watched quite many hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries such as next or transsiberian why did he do it and after i had watched stalingrad i cannot make out the european actors desire to appear in american movies even secondrated at any cost the fact puzzles me deeply i believe thomas kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in hollywood and out of what i saw with him stalingrad is the best beyond the doubt  in my opinion the worst stalingrad drawback is the way they speak russian in the movie i mean of course those who are supposed to be russian say the boy who spent some time with the germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent initially i set down to watch stalingrad just to listen to native germanspeakers because im studying the language i did not expect anything extraordinary of the film but it impressed me made me cry when i wasnt going to at all i know im 15 years late to watch it but stalingrad is not a runofthemill movie and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking,1
there are lot of similarities between never say never again and thunderball not only on sean connery but also the story and plot except the actors all other are same like hijacking atomic bombs asking for ransom trafficking nukes in a ship etc only difference are place of occurrence in thunder ball plot it is in bahamas in never say never again it is over north africa and in thunder ball the nato  raf itself loads the nukes into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an rouge arm of the axe and air dropped over us and stolen in caribbean almost 99 is sameif anybody wants to dispute this they are most welcome,1
i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film im glad i read twice the book first which is usually the case for me i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly but still its often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts  i realize that davies is a very good adapter but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay davies as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book i certainly enjoyed those on film as in the book but davies missed a halfdozen moments that are so excruciatingly painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine   i also would take issue with his use of the books primary symbol the rose  as the screenplay was plotted by davies the denouement was inevitable and appropriate but i really think that author waters final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting and i preferred way the novel let nan come of age than the way davies chose  one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles they are all wonderfully talented  well except for the singing and dancing perhaps  and moreover their physical presences are so much what the minds eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film i thought they were all terrific  i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their bookshelves,1
i really wanted to love this movie and not only cause it had aaron eckhart in it but i thought the premise would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that revolves around chefs the cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very clich oh and little miss sunshine was very irritating in this movie although abigail breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny it has some decent flashes of cooking but food really didnt play a big part in the movie than i expected which was a big disappointment for me this film had some good potential the cast was great but they just had very little to work with i like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland and longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is its not a terrible movie you just wont miss anything by not watching this movie  4510,0
really really what pleases audience american one in this so called show is totally beyond me what can we learn from these series  1 each casino there is spending about 23 billion bucks every year to rent a satellite and enormous quantity of hi tech high resolution cameras for their security team let fbi bites the dust of them  2 every security employee must have voluptuous breasts of course natural ones the tits must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job   3 if the employee happens to be a male he needs to get breasts implanted then go to step 2   4 only in hollywood one can blatantly rip off other shows ideas then implement them as their own and call all this crap original and art   5 every security with tits bigger than 39d is considered immortal and cannot die  i really would like to have the opportunity to vote with minus values 1010 for this one,0
coming from the druggie generation i thought this movie was hilarious it definitely brought jekyll  hyde uptodate so to speak my husband and i laughed all the way through it would love to have the movie in my collection i told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it they arent into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie its been so long since ive seen it i cant remember but a few things i would have to say the funniest part was when dr jekyll dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw while snoring then snorted up the powdered drug he had invented funniest thing id ever seen in a movie,1
i liked the first the grudge it really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice that something was missing from this sequel there was no creativity nothing new or original nothing that really sticks to your mind its people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo and most of the time it wasnt even all that scary  plotwise this movie is a dead end amber tamblyn is a good actress but she was given nothing to do and karens death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly i was also disappointed in the kayakos mother subplot i was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the grudge but she dies in the hands  hair  of kayako that was such a stupid twist all in all its difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die all in the same way and theres nothing they can do it doesnt feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them its just boring because you know whats going to happen if they had anything to fight it with that would have added suspense even if they failed if there was any hope it would make the scares more justified now youre just waiting for them to die  kayako was really scary in the first movie but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it i was still scared during some scenes but i actually got used to the huge eye and blue face the makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts yes i was scared at the school psychologist scene  even if i knew where it was going as soon as she said ive been to the house a nice touch toshio however was not scary at all in this movie i was much more creeped out by the nonblue toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie a blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me  some of the characters seemed really unnecessary  the notorious milkscene with the girl whose name i cant even remember comes to mind i wasnt scared it was just huh im not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed karen could have brought the grudge to the us with her it could have killed people related to her life everyone at the funeral or something like that even so it would have been dull to watch them all die but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying hated the i wont call you mother scene aubreys mother issues were equally dull the little boy was a touching character though  the juon sequel was much scarier than this one it had some new twists  dreams and reality blurring much more for instance  and even if it left me feeling quite down i was also somehow satisfied i got to think a bit and be left wondering this movie only provided cheap scares,0
a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island that keeps many of the novels characteristics i think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie one thing i didnt like at all though is that the main characters like mandras and pelagias father werent greek actors but foreigners i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didnt succeed and it was quite clear even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the films plot irene papas was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the 40s who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone john hurt pelagias father also acted great he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions,1
ok i will make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie everybody knows of motion picture association of americas ratings g pg pg13 r and nc17 for the purposes of this movie i think the mpa should create a new rating standard iq20,0
having grown up a mormon and grappled with the churchs bigotry towards blacks they were not allowed to hold the churchs priesthood when i was a member  i wasnt aware of the organizations policy of excommunicating gay men and women until after i left the church in 1966  i was 20 i was stunned when i learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions latter days exposes the mormons persecution of gay members the film is long overdue it does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals latter days has great heart wonderful original music and an added touch of class from jacqueline bisset the film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and reclaims his very soul,1
the good news is that the circus is in town the bad news is thats right over bugs bunnys underground home he wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by etc  to be more specific the lions cage is place exactly over bugs hole the lion sniffs food and by process of elimination figures out its a rabbit bugs curious what all the racket is about winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the lions mouth  ill say for thing for bb he is totally fearless at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds when he comes to his senses he runs like crazy and we get a lionversusa rabbit battle the rest of the way once again bugs faces dumb opponent one he calls nero but lion is fierce and bugs will need all his wits and somewhatfake bravado to fend off this beast  about half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fastmoving colorful and good enough to recommend i mean its not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze or doing a hula dance,1
bedrooms and hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 melbourne film festival from the uk it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas much of the humour is centred around a newagey mens selfhelp group where they pass around various implements like the rock of truth they also go on a hunter gatherer weekend with hilarious results trust me youll laugh your teeth out,1
fascinating and amusingly bad lights of new york is the first all talkie feature and one that almost never saw the light of day  two naive barbers eddie and gene from out of town get involved with bootleggers and end up fronting a speak when a cop is shot by one of the bootleggers the police start to close in and the hawk who shot the officer decides to pin the murder on eddie instructing his henchman to take him for a ride but its the hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few  shot in one week at a cost of 23000 lights was originally meant as a two reeler but foy took advantage of jack warners absence to extend it to six when warner discovered this he ordered foy to cut it back to the original short only when an independent exhibitor offered 25k for the film did warners actually look at the film which went on to make a staggering 13 million  seen now this is an extremely hokey piece with acting that ranges from the passable eugene pallette to trance like eddies granny in a particularly risible scene and much of the playing is at the level of vaudeville since its an early talkie 4 parttalkies preceded it thats about all the characters do and very slowly at that the script feels improvised visual style is non existent apart from the shooting scene done in silhouette and scenes grind on interminably title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales  despite all this lights is a compelling experience as we watch actors and crew struggling with the alien technology and changing cinema for ever  catch it if you can,1
ill bet i watch this film 4 or 5 times a year and will do so more often now that the hollyweird moguls have seen fit to put it on dvd because its a classic with a capital c this film is timeless how can people pay 1000 nowadays to see the junk that comes out of hollyweird with movies like the egyptian the ten commandments ben hur captain newman md on tape dvd and cable movie channels i could go on forever but this film is so great and for a relative unknown edmund purdom carries the movie like atlas carried the world the story is wonderful the acting is firstrate and the graphics at the end are so powerful you sit in your seat for a few minutes just trying to let the words sink in really a knockout of a film id give this one 15 stars if theyd let me they dont make them like this anymore but they should,1
what an excellent movie made even more so by the fact that my wife and i stumbled onto it so serendipitously channel surfing on a nice frozen day in north texas kathy bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies weve ever seen why this movie wasnt given the attention it deserved on its release in 2002 is difficult to understand why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing it is obvious that we as a general public are being forcefed that which has been deemed great and wonderful by the powerful and influential while true gems such as unconditional love manage to shine thru all those pretenders to really enjoyable cinema rent or buy this movieyou wont regret it,1
i remember watching this film in 1981 when i was 7 it was absolutely brilliant i found the dvd just a couple of months ago i was nearly jumping up and down with glee i bought it and showed it to my kids they loved it too they asked what words the seahorse was singing i didnt tell them though because i dont think telling the words gay and ecstasy to 6 year old kids is very good parenting the songs are brilliant i still remember them all ill still remember them when im 60 there or near abouts tommy pender is was such a brilliant actor its a pity he gave it up  if you find the film buy it youll love it,1
one of the most successful shows in television history is back now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all but the new show is impressive  scifi has premiered the first two episodes rose and the end of the world this weekend we meet rose a twentysomething clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor using the internet she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes death follows when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time traveling in a tardis disguised a 50sstyle police call box  she helps him save the worldthere wouldnt be a show otherwiseand decides to join him but when he puts her life in danger he is distraught and questions whether her company was worth the risk  although the special effects are kinda lame and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy doctor who is after two episodes aired in the us a smart wellwritten work apparently the second season has already aired in the uk so i predict the same success here,1
the movie was fantastic if your a fan of bams cky videos jackass or his show viva la bam you cant help but like it i have a few friends who arent fans that enjoyed it and others who thought it wasnt that great those who didnt like it were mostly female friends they really didnt appreciate some of the crude humor that personally i think made the movie so funny im pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in bams home town which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations the cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too the soundtrack is phenomenal with music by him in my opinion haggard has it all a great plot characters youll never see anywhere else plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project,1
what a bloody nuisance you cant get on subjects like these with tv budgets and some smartass director who cant tell the difference between a lanc i ii and iii all the silly clichs are well in place on the character and human level the story is so schmaltzy and unbelievable it hurts and all those responsible get carried away with joy for the brilliant ratings tech details rubbish lancs flying that close would have kicked each other out of the sky by the dozen single engined night fighters attacking line astern ridiculous as i said made up by a director who i bet never even heard the name lancaster before that project and some kid 3d guys who turned lancs into waddling ducks but these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film although it might be too harsh i dare say this hurts the memory of those who died on both sides tv crap entertaining the dumb masses who dont care anyway shame on those responsible use your brains next time and enjoy the profit you made from it,0
most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life there is about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments our actress are treated like pieces of ass and seem to be perfectly happy with their position the lead characters these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them the story steps all over itself and when it finally gets to the final battle its no more than a volleyball match that doesnt last long enough to make up with this trashed script raped from the oc,0
spreading panic from broadway to bombay 1957s the giant claw boasts perhaps the ultimate flying monster in movie history described by one terrified quebecois witness as la carcagne  shes de devil in de storm with de face of de wolf and de body of de woman with wings bigger than i can tell it doesnt say much for canadian women since when we finally see it in focus its a cross between an overgrown buzzard a chickenhawk and gonzo the great but this isnt just any old giant turkey  impervious to rockets invisible to radar and with a taste for swallowing parachutists whole and pecking away at the united nations building its an extraterrestrial giant turkey from an antimatter galaxy millions of miles from earth thats come here to build a nest no other explanation is possible luckily for humanity jeff morrow test pilot and chief cook and bottle washer in a oneman birdwatching society invents a weapon to disable its impenetrable shield so they can hit it with everything but the kitchen sink  but dont worry morris ankrums general assures him weve got kitchen sinks to spare son  just in time for a lastminute clinch with costar mara corday some of the dialogue has dated rather unfortunately  i admire your spunk and you keep climbing on our backs whenever weve messed up  and strangely enough its nowhere near as much fun as a film with a giant flying turkey should be but the beast itself is such a truly memorable creation for all the wrong reasons that its hard to dislike even if you are liking it for all the wrong reasons and full marks to the cast for delivering gem after gem of direlogue with a straight face honest to pete ill never call my motherinlaw an old crow again the only trouble is that the last time i talked to a chaplain there wasnt any telephone line to the one and only place where we can get the kind of help we need and the immortal there it is now attacking the united nations building,0
this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny  it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isnt  brilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics i suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anyway  the main problem i have with this movie is that i cant see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships  if anything they are embarrassing  just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better  the acting is not bad udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl a lighter version than of a venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler oi vai,0
we dont know if darlene loves all three gentleman certainly they are wary of one another yet they live together viewers might surmise that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward darlene might make for an unbearable home life  in the eerily beautiful rural brazilian landscape emphasized by the frequent use of polarization and the use of kodachrome stock anything might happen and the alternatives for any one of them save perhaps ciro may not be alluring enough to encourage them to change their circumstances they seem to bear the intolerable because it is familiarthe unknown frightens them into complacency toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can utilize thus it crushes them rather than strengthening them the web in which they are caught is made of the sanguine filaments which bind us all perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with its portrayal of the inevitable fading of our youths bright colors in the unforgiving light of time the three children will enter the world fated to relive their parents lives to one or another degree well filmed and portrayed the story is tragic in its essence walt disney it aint,0
if this is not my favorite movie of all time it definitely is in the top five i love this everything about this is perfectthe clothes the set the linesyes theyre not how normal people talk but right down to the small scenes especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes picking a wedgie watering the office ivy plant putting lunch in the fridge identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005 i think all the minor characters are wonderful if someone like joan crawford is over the top its all part of the package if you pick out many things in the movie it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not take it lying down at least not if they didnt want to as far as characters being contradictory for instance suzy parkers character acting like shes all for flings but then getting too attached to louis jourdans character isnt that what many people are likecontradictory they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane bakers character finding the love of her life after miscarrying her illegitimate baby in an accidentlying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head this is part of the package too its charmglossy escapism i like the mix of real stories pertinent today the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men therefore doesnt have a family when she is older with ones that make you wish ah if only i could fall in love with a doctor and hell love me even though he knows my sordid past and saw me all messed up after the scandalous accident also i just got the dvd widescreen its yet even more beautiful than full screen yay,1
i watched this film in the theater in edinbourgh along with 3 other americans and our friend from manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time we would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of star wars iii that was playing down the hall than all of this   opening with one of the worst jokes ive ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen it did not take off with a bang throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldnt even smile i cite the giraffe cumming as a prime example   the plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen i think a lot more could have been done with that angle the two different worlds the fishoutofwater experience of the characters the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other but too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much bizarre and goof as is humanly possible   and to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought but no its a full length torture film of unfunniness   as we were leaving the theater which had very little laughing inside it i overheard the young hip electroclash british couple behind me saying that was rather good wasnt it you never really knew what was coming next and the girl responding yeah quite surprising and that was it if this is what is meant to get out of british people from watching a comedy no laughing for 90 minutes but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers at the end then this film succeeded but i have more belief in british life than that  ive not notlaughed so hard at a comedy film since american pie ii,0
i have to admit that i approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread louis de bernieres bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100 faithful   all the way through i found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful and had stripped the books plot back so far as to render it redundant the ending however is much better than that in the novel and i could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards still the plusses john tolls magnificent cinematography stephen warbecks great score etc i felt did not outweigh my initial negatives cages miscasting a heavily diluted script  but two days later i was queuing again to see corelli and although not perfect i have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on and complements the superb double act of penelope cruz and john hurt perfectly david morrissey is quietly effective as weber the nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him and the fine grecoitalian supporting cast bring de bernieres sundrenched world of cepholonia dazzlingly alive  on leaving the cinema second time around i finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of ww2 cepholonia in cinematic terms my hat goes off to john madden who despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the british critics any director who has had a major success like shakespeare in love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnieshas managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart verve and humanity the core virtues of the novel in fact that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now  if you are a fan of the book like me its hard but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing try to erase the book from your mind for two hours bathe yourself in the glorious mediterranean atmosphere and discover corelli pelagia mandras dr iannis as if for the first time pretend youre watching something made from an original screenplay and i guarantee you wont be disappointed   in fact youll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or dvd  810,1
is the cannes controversymeter remarkably esoteric or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore be that as it may with plenty of careful analyzing falscher bekenner at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in 2005 a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to its glum american retitle low profile  building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation kind of admittedly its a film not without its surfacelevel interests it starts out with a grabber as a haunting shot of a desolate offthehighway road focuses in on a teenage drifter who ultimately walks by a totaled car where supposedly a brutal hitandrun has left the driver dead in a gory mess stunned he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine  just out of school the drifter turns out to be armin steebe a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it every one with the same fruitless outcome getting mighty sick of it his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit  pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if hes doing nothing out of the ordinary  if you seem confused about what exactly is going on dont worry about being the only one this is about as far and coherent as the story gets the plot seems simple enough and perhaps due to its seemingly direct purposes thats why falscher bekenner becomes pointlessly convoluted becoming enamored with endless false conclusions dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument supposedly the soulnumbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland or something about youths fascination with crime hey it could even be a comingout movie at hand it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols both tangible and surrealistically allegorical but they dont seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest   the most fatal flaw however is how the filmmakers paint all its characters in a rough shade of vanilla theres hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose and how the secondary characters especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal perhaps too normal family catalyze the already underdeveloped lead characters plight never comes into focus how are we supposed to identify with this young almostadults rebellion with little sense of the world hes living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it   many people drop in and out of the movie including armins sortof girlfriend katja and a strange affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next  and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality especially with armins nightly exploits it ends with a literal almost moralizing headscratcher that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put its viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion  without any color its impossible to shade anything vital in,0
well that was sure a waste of dave mckeans talents wasnt it dont get me wrong when it comes to graphic design dave mckean may be the best in the world right now the layered textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like peter greenaway and david fincher look like what they are hackwork mckean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics film even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered  but this movie its junk complete junk the story from neil gaiman is unfortunately exactly what gaiman has been giving us ever since he ripped off clive barker for the first time a pseudomythic overblown dreamscape populated by characters which have titles in all capital letters rather than names everything is allegory to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama emotion or empathy from anyone involved people make pithy postulations speaking in riddles which bring to mind what rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead might have sounded like if tom stoppard had suffered a debilitating stroke halfway through its composition really gaiman get over yourself youre not a prophet youre a poser  mckeans directing doesnt help  his pacing is poor taking fully half an hour to actually rev himself up for the main picaresque plot and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events none of them given any weight the monsters dont menace because theyre not foreshadowed simply thrown at the screen the plot doesnt engage because we dont really care about the rancid little protagonists half the dialogue muttered into into shirt fronts and ubiquitous masks is unintelligible  some of the visuals are pretty and im sure the fanboys will lick it up pity think of the amount of really good work mckean could have produced if he hadnt been stuck with this lame project  grade dd,0

i understand that people have different expectations of lowbudget arthouse movies i also know that john sayles has a sort of glow about him that earthy intellectual antihollywood vibe a la tim robbins the coen brothers and atom egoyan that makes him a darling with the critics from the getgo  but this is not a good movie im sorry it just isnt  it meanders it has too many characters its tone is uneven its point of view is muddled the acting is all over the board from naturalistic to over the top it lingers for long moments with minor characters we dont care about and cuts away from tense scenes just when things are getting good  it misses the mark  the worst flaw in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist edie falcos marly and angela bassetts desiree are straightjacketed in characters that have no drive marly is an apathetic drunk steeped in her lifes own inertia desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain when your two main characters worldviews can be summed up with the phrases i dont care and i want to leave here why should the audience give a rats patootie  ill be plain sayles writes funny dialogue hes very adept at crafting a scene the problem is these scenes dont go anywhere theres no spine to the movie no drive the movie doesnt create rooting interest in any of the characters in my opinion hes also too preachy about big bad corporate america gobbling up the little guy   if you want to see a quality small movie see david lynchs straight story pass this one up,0
robert altman nicolas roeg johnluc goddardyou were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream but created it for those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the operahow often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film it is the mood that counts this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing creating a contemporary mood for old operas for the most part they succeed wonderfully with all these operas who is going to like them all we could have used more beverly sills  finally what is art even opera without a few naked women,1
i really dont think its necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as snake island but even in the abstract confines of its own genre this hit a new low so my anger must be known the only reason why i even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad it was really late at night i could not sleep and in the past really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber it became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful but it condescended below even those expectations  the movie was directed and written by wayne crawford who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the african river who ends up having to strand his team on a remote island called snake island until another boat comes down to pick them up they hang out get drunk and then become subject to the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island of human beings  if your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph dont bother to reread it you got it right the first time frankly i prefer my creature features when the creatures just attack the nonsensically dumb humans out of hunger not because they have some kind of a mission these arent mutant snakes theyre not giants like what you see in anaconda theyre just ordinary everyday african snakes like mambas and vipersonly they have the brains to form armies take up causes work together to trap people understand our language and even dance did your draw drop again well its going to drop further amount midway through this awful bmovie about the part where id already given up the human characters start drinking around a campfire and then all of a sudden they break down into some kind of an orgy and while they dance nude and such the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start jamming along to it the combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes some the most roguish creatures on the planet have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason proved just too much for my poor brain and just when i though the filmmakers couldnt take it to an even lower level the snakes started to sing  the people in the movie well lets just say that never before have i rooted for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly i just could not stand it any longer  i really dont think i need to keep going on you get the picture if there is anything that makes snake island any different from its other rivals its that it does dare to try to be even dumber and thats not a complimentary achievement whyjust whyi continue to subject myself to these really bad movies i guess ill never really know but snake island hits a brand new low its a cheap trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes anaconda a brainless snake movie look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as steven spielbergs jaws you have been warned,0
one day someone said lets redo the mod squad we can make it hip cool and all that yoitll make a mint then they actually made it and as you are watching it you can hear your spleen cringe in agony as it twists and binds into a knot from the pure horror of it all any movie ever made has something on this id rather meet wayne newton and sing karaoke with him in a gay bar in idaho and drink a virgin bloody mary than ever watch this again may god have mercy on my soul,0
this is on my tv right now but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment the previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better no matter how much i hope and pray i will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time and would be of your timeit is not going to get any better i cant believe this screenwriter is doing atlas shrugged i hope he has improved a millionfold i see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews but im still not convinced if you are familiar with his work please post something here because i really want to see atlas shrugged and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be,0
i had read the newspaper reviews of this film and i must say my expectations were very low before watching oceans 12 i really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever i would rate it top 5 of the worst movie i have ever seen why do i say that first of all there is a story so thin that britney spears crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller the fragments that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive the entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times  the actors show up but doesnt do anything to deserve any credit or appraise most embarrassing are leading ladies roberts and zetajones that either overplay or are extremely plain damon clooney and pitt arent brilliant either to be honest i really dont understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie   may contains spoilers  camera and editing sigh where should i begin there are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car the camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects  not i understand that the scene with tess ocean julia roberts playing julia roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess bruce willis why please explain it to me why  to summarize  if you have to choose between root canal work and watching oceans 12 i recommend the former make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it,0

with pep squad receiving an average of 47 on imdbcom no wonder steve balderson slanders this website so but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted black comedy both words in quotation marks for a reason its a movie full of overacting cherry beths mother coupled with a couple of lethargic performances beth and julies boyfriend a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed a movie chock full of notsoappetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder does the director think this is funny or clever most of all the characters are so paperthin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable but probably not on purpose pep squad cant decide whether to be a comedy or a drama or a satire patriotic music i get it the movie fails at being serious because the idea of killing for any school position this being prom queen crosses the line into insanity not to mention shots of flag burning and driveby shootings a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy and fails at being a comedy for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes big butt mama funky black principal and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast watching the documentary wamego making movies anywhere only made this film more cringeworthy with praise lauded towards it by the director and the directors father hmmmmmm not a black comedy or anything for that matter i guess kansas will have to wait,0
the year still has three weeks to go but unless a really horrendous turkey shows up before then passion of the mind may be the winner of my lousiest movie of the year contest an interesting idea badly executed and for that matter badly acted demi moore is very good at curling her lip and smoking cigarettes but is that all she does and why so many cigarettes did ligitt and myers or one of the other bad boys of nicotine have some of their illicit profits invested in this production its confusing silly and moves at the frantic past of a arthritic earthworm i gave it a 3 should have been a 2,0
first snow has an intriguing beginning a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man whos predictions turn out to be amazingly correct from this point on the movie plays out like a bloated twilight zone episode i mean nothing but car trips phone calls and paranoia william fichtner gives his usual interesting performance but guy pierce is anything but a sympathetic character disregarding other peoples well being for the sake of his own paranoia the ending is especially weak with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience do yourself a big favor and avoid this one not recommended  merk,0
eighteen 2004 tells the story of pip anders a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is estranged from his dysfunctional uppermiddle class family and living on the streets of vancouver on his 18th birthday he receives a cassette tape and player from his recentlydeceased grandfather relating his memoirs of his own 18th birthday spent serving with the british army in france trying to help a mortallywounded comrade avoid capture by the occupying germans as pip listens to the tape ian mckellen provided the voice of his grandfather we see the scenes he is describing as flashbacks alternating with daily scenes of pips life as well as more recent flashbacks filling in the dark secret why pip left home and finds it impossible to trust anyone who is nice to him  an ambitious second film from writerdirector richard bell two brothers with a polished look excellent photography welldeveloped nonstereotypical characters with gay and straight treated equally and commendable efforts in emotionally and physicallydemanding roles from some talented new actors especially paul anthony as pip and brendan fletcher as his grandfather at 18 there is also a noteworthy turn by alan cummings as a priest who tried to help pip and a small supporting role played by thea gill queer as folk the complex story  in the directors own words in his dvd commentary  is meant to drive a vortex of emotion pushing pip to his breaking point and it certainly accomplishes that my only criticisms are that the overall effect is too schmaltzy or artificial for an audience to truly identify with much of the supporting dialog and the ending too contrived and predictable and the direction needed to be sharper to curtail sloppy overacting in some scenes i do recommend it 7 stars out of 10 including extra points for a noteworthy effort,1
as much as i love the story of david copperfield i cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen one problem i see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours rather than a regular movie it is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours i dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format it was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp also i dont think the filmmakers interpreted copperfields personality correctly the idea of him strolling around on a beach moaning about his life seems inconsistent with the proactive forwardthinking nature dickens gave him in the novel agnes also bothered me she came across as a ditsy household decoration rather than a strong woman dora was perfect however this movie was fraught with problems and i wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version,0
after reading other reviews on this site we werent sure if we were going to be able to critique this movie because it didnt sound bad enough however 2 minutes into the movie we knew we were in for another flop no summer is complete without ice cream but this movie served up a melted sour brokenbottomed ice cream cone you know the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wetnap the biggest problem with this movie was the plot what was it it appeared to be a psychotic ice cream man driving around the neighborhood thats it nothing else happens first of all what are the qualifications for becoming an icecream man in this crap town 1 spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man this hospital was plagued with clowns graffiti fake plastic sunflowers and oversized syringes to the head 2 have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids away 3 make sure your truck is stocked with severed body parts roaches and dont forget the eye whites  the actors in this movie are pure bmovie caliber mixed in with a bunch of unknowns is who other thana trailertrash version of macaulay culkin even his bratty charm couldnt save this kick in the pants there seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie the whole concept of the movie reeked who would kill an ice cream man in a driveby shooting gangsters fiends vanna white who we are still struggling with this question  whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted from hollywood did they honestly think a pillow under a kids shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat did they forget about the arms face legs and all other body parts second of all this movie was made in 1995 yet the wardrobe seemed to be picked from a lame 80s movie evidenced by the big brothers white crotchhugging highwater pants  while we were watching this shotty production we both developed severe cases of add we found ourselves leaving the room to walk around aimlessly at many points it the movie we found that staring at a blank wall behind the tv set was more entertaining than the actual movie we were stunned that this movie didnt make it to the bottom 100 afterwards we took the tape out of the vcr and left it on the black top to melt like a substandard ice cream cone,0
nuri bilge ceylans 2002 film distant uzak his third feature film his first was 1997s black and white the small town kasaba is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film clouds of may mayis sikintisi the earlier film had potential but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs that clouds of may succeeded on any level was a testament to ceylans talent as a budding filmmaker however distant is ceylans arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like ingmar bergman although his screenplay is not as dialogueheavy it is just as brooding and he lacks bergmans penchant for closeups his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors and yasujiro ozu whose penetrating scenes of contemplation ceylan reconfigures the bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal istanbul the fact that it snows in turkey will likely surprise some which lends the film a definite bergmanian feel as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from krzysztof kieslowskis the decalogue the natural images invoke the best of werner herzog as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate which is what makes them even more memorable while the urban landscapes range from the nearly precisionist compositions of michelangelo antonioni to the cultural hagiography of woody allen one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation read steal from manhattan save the lack of the brooklyn bridge in the background in another scene ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from ozus tokyo story yet like all great artists ceylan makes his appropriations his own art by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own films needs distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them but it does not describe the film itself for scenes stay with one long after the film ends perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when mahmut stalks his exwife at the istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever as he watches her from a distance we see her catch just a glance of him watching her will she leave her husband and return to mahmut not in this film he pulls back behind a column and nazan merely turns her head back to her future mahmut is her past and she knows how to best move on just keep moving mahmut will never get it most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life that some viewers will get the film and that ceylan gets his own powers of creation shows that ignorance can teach as long as one moves about it distant does albeit it at just the right length,1
skip this hollywood version a real piece of garbage a cheap insult to the brilliant original spoorloos or by the english title also called the vanishing it completely misses the mark in typical grotesque hollywood fashion usually due to a bunch of talentless corporate bean counters who havent the vaguest idea about anything artistic they just look for the successful formula and want it applied to everything to glean a profit much like the awful the scarlet letter made in 1995 which twisted the original story around so much to suit the macdonaldsland crowd that it became an aberration not even a bastardization but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original except that movie at least had gary oldman who is interesting to watch in anything he does this dog has nothing going for it even the usually very talented jeff bridges is an embarrassment great tragedy is not nor never should be the feel good movie of the year but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the readerviewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition  do yourself a great favor if youre looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a dutchfrench collaboration in 1988 that is a great film this is a horrific mess,0
i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein carradine is much more passable  his acting isnt as ridiculous  overboard as in hof the actors deliver solid enough performances the subplots eg the monster the village mobsters the village idiot the hunchback nurse etc  are mixed in well so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof better run than the stitchedtogether hof the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof the doctor is very good as well lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman worth watching twice a classic universal horror with that typical 1940s long lost flair especially good is the doctors performance beforeafter his blood had been contaminated with draculas,1
all i can say is that i was expecting a wick movie and blurred surprised me on the positive way very nice teenager movie all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes its good to watch this kind of movies because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years when we were young as well lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present timetry this movie and you will be very pleasedat the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted,1
i thought this was a really cute movie  inspiring makes me want to try acting i love kelly ripa and its nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children  ive already watched it 3 times of course i also loved seeing joe barbara  especially since another world went off the air,1
excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal it is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing in the case of full ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story i was too busy during first and only viewing alternating between laughter and nausea  fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting riley smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters  unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and monroes staggering lack of talent on the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter  better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age the basic story is not particularly original just another variation on an officer and a gentleman but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actors  then again what do i know im just a child,0
after reading the comment made about this movie and currently watching it i can understand how the person felt about it the decisions made were after listening to common sense when the movie came out i had heard the information as to how it came about the storyline was made from an actual event during an award show an actor thanking the lil people attributed the award to a former school teacher unexpectedly outing the person  of course many people come out of the closet most every day each outing is different for each person in real life the outcome of any individual is gonna be different as well and a willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to reach personal happiness for those around them the joy and honest acceptance can make life much more fuller for the movie the outcome of how howard is outed is a lot more comical than real life and the acceptance of the community showed the others that howard was himself and nothing else  overall the performances were crazy the memorable quotes and use of music add to the stereotypes out there in the world but taken with tongue and cheek humour its a movie sit down watch with an open mind and laugh your head off,1
i for one was actually expecting this movie to be pretty good maybe my expectations were a bit to high but the fact is i love judd nelson in fact he is the only reason this movie is worth watching and really his role isnt all that great the main highlights of this film are raunchy sex scenes and boring dialog if those are the highlights im sure your getting a pretty good idea of what kind of film this is there is definitely a reason this was a made for television film only see this one if you have nothing better to do on a friday night or just like to waste money on video rentals save your time and rent the breakfast club,0
martin lawrence is not a funny man i runteldat he just has too much on his mind and he is too mad which trips his puns pretty early in the game he tries to make fun of critics which boils down to f them then he goes on to rather primitive sexual jokes on smokers with throat cancer and it just goes downhill from there 310,0
if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands the world would be in grave danger i am a huge fan of b movies and i have seen my share of bad ones but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke this movie even surpasses the so bad its good phase and goes straight on to the so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it phase  it is hard to say what is more disturbing 1 the fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire i use the term very very very loosely was witty enough to film 2 they were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money 3 that someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick this crap up for distribution on a horror anthology dvd  were i a weaker man i most likely would have jammed grapefruit spoons into my eyes and then blindly flung myself to my death in oncoming traffic after watching this as it stands though i live but i am forever scarred by the experience,0
jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men which he perfected in this series he longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed and the tetatet between him and his partners girlfriends best friend are pretty funny then they realize that theyre attracted to each other and start dating in one of the funniest lines on tv ever  i think in the final episode  he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl   his partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting whats the worst that can happen she says no  armed with newfound optimism he proposes to his date over dinner to which she replies   god no  i laughed so hard i cried,1
this is the epitome of bad 80s filmmaking unless you are a prepubescent girl riding on a big name like madonna a story line that physically assaults ones intelligence and humour that is most suited for a nursery school if there was ever any doubt i think this turd of a movie clearly displays madonnas absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel highly embarrassed on her behalf the only thing i cant believe is that they ever let the director near another movie again madonna spends most of the movie prancing around like an infantile rag doll and talking like a baby it is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was ever made was due to the fact that madonna was a big name in pop music at the time do not be duped into seeing this awful attempt to cash in on pop stardom stay away at all costs,0
a bit too much mediterrenean machismo for me the cast was beautiful lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes the locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water it just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building could attract so many beautiful vulnerable women only in the mediterranean i guess certainly in no world i am familiar with the macho men were really obnoxious and i found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long the screenplay cinematography directing etc was set up to deliver a class b film the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts it was aesthetically nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film,0
the only pure life is one that ends with a signature in blood  so says mishima anyway a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicideshown in color flashbacksshown in black and white and scenes from his novelsshown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and the wizard of oz these stories are often told at the same time but are edited to reinforce the slow fusing of mishimas life with his fictions until the endor the beginning when like the ancient samurai he so admires he will be at a balance of pen and sword when his words and actions are the same and he is a full and pure being  paul schrader wrote the screen play for taxi driver and directed cat peoplea bizarre erotic horror film which left strange impressions on me as a boy and in mishima he comes closest to making a really excellent film  whats interesting is to watch the poet the homosexual the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 of which he seems forever ashamed become a body building samurai obsessed asexual media phenomena all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels plays and short stories  a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity beauty sex and self destruction in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself that he was always missing watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets you see him happy delivering his big paternal speech giving orders and loving the controluntil the speech itself the point where pen and sword meet of course this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable   though the story fascinating at times really isnt this movies greatest success the cinematography performances editingmusicby philip glass and set designs are really what make this worth seeing and more than a traditional biopic  one day i will pick up a mishima book he does seem to have an ear for prose and for staging ideas but for now im satisfied with the film  those interested in japanese literature and postwar culture should check out fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should enjoy as well,1
i am the kind of person who can enjoy a good b movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it but dead space has nothing to redeem it this is the kind of film that will make you frustrated restless and sick to your stomach   bad acting lame story terrible effects horrible excruciating dialogue dead space has it all,0
i hate you you hate me barney stole your suv with a great big bunch and a kick from me to you wont you say you hate me too jingle bells batman smells grandma had a gun shot barney and made him pee and now there is no more barney the moron now why the heck would come up with a idiotic show like barney  so what im saying is barney is a retard from the underground world and the kids on this show are like 12 years old if i were them i wouldnt believe this stupid idiot called barneynow producers why do you believe this crap that barney says they are always happy that is stupidthey should be sad sometimes am i right bottom line barney is so stupid who watches that ugly creature,0
smashing film about filmmaking shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors  their actors the manipulation and mind games the preening egotism of performers as in any workplace sexuality complicates matters but here to the nth degree as they are filming a sex scene  absolutely fantastic performances from gregoire colin as the fragile wannabe macho male lead and  supremely  anne parillaud as the directors selfportrait the image of her laughing  eating a banana at the end having finally got what she wants out of her puppets is pure delight,1
i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on mystery science theater have received a tons of low ratings on imdb however a few of the films featured on the films werent that bad and its not fair to rate a film thats been given the mst treatmentwith the hosts making funny comments during the film now i am not saying that the girl in lovers lane is a great film but its not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 21  the film begins with bix and danny meeting bix is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country once they blow into a small town bix needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naivea nice way of saying he has the intellect of a tomato  along the way something happens to the selfassured bixhe finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him and in an odd subplot jack elam plays a supercreepy sicko who wanders the town scaring the crap out of everyoneyet oddly the police dont seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him ultimately however when elam puts the moves on a girl who bix is falling for things come to a full boil  overall while not at all a great film there were many interesting plot elements in this filmenough to merit a score higher than 21 the biggest negatives are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often considering the minuscule budget however its a watchable little film,0
perhaps not miyazakis best work but i couldnt help but love it to death a fiveyear old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle he saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet but it really is a magical being the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess ponyo as the boy names her is taken back to the sea by her father who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do the story is simple and cute where the film really comes alive though is in its tremendous artwork the drawings are more childlike than in any of miyazakis other works but theres beauty in its simplicity as with all of his films miyazaki creates this world of imagination that i was just so in awe of seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of jo hisaishis score for princess mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago the score here is equally as wonderful i wanted to live in this world and never leave it,1
i think that you can not imagine how these people really work before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there i actually thought quite the same as you do but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tvshow have to do i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act i dont think that the material given to them can really show that as i think this material isnt very good but they are truly good so i dont think that you before you havent seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and i shouldnt have judged over them as well before i met them but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent seen them doing there job,0
he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster and if you gaze for long into an abyss the abyss gazes also into you  yes this is from nietzsches aphorism 146 from beyond good and evil and thats what you find at the start of this movie  if you watch the whole movie you will doubt if it was the message that the ram gopal varma production wanted to pass on as the scenes crop up one by one quite violent and at times pukeraking the viewer is expected to forget the nietzsche quote and think otherwise that to deal with few people you need dedicated people like sadhu agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone not just writing firs something unworthy of the police to do as we are made to believe  when tada was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws rgvs satya did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like india within a year mcoca was passed  when real life encounter specialist daya nayak became a monster on the path of fighting them and was himself booked by mcoca aab tak chhappan was made to heed out false impression among the people about this with its you have to be a monster to save your nation approach  and people consumed it no questions raised only praises and hopes that they get a sadhu agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over blood you can ignore  every time israel attacks palestine or lebanon we hear voices like india must also similarly attack pakistan this movie is made for such psychopaths if you dont give them this they will probably die out of boredom and lsd and what not  hence this game of the passion of hatred,0
this is probably the second best of the death wish movies death wish 5 is the best one  death wish 3 reminds me of west side story with a new twist not even the recent flick gangs of new york can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangsbut one big gang a gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set  deborah raffin who plays a public defender plays gently in this actionpacked movie that is filled with a lot of shootemup violence so like geri nichols in death wish ii death wish iii scores with its gentle romantic moments as well as its violent moments only the james bond loveinterest scenes would do much better  and in addition to his 38 kersee plays with this new gun called the wildey 475 magnum it reminded me of the dirty harry movies when callahan used his 44 magnum in magnum force sudden impact and dirty harry the wildey gun packs a big punch and when kersey kills with it he doesnt care if the gun has a big kick in it  and that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader well that is something kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weaponthat is way too military for him,1
this is one of the best movies ive seen the acting is good the plot is solid and the whole movie is very believable which adds a lot to the movie i rate this at least a 9,1
first of all this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it since i myself did not understand this horrible story further the unknown cast leaded by an actress called laura mennell is simply awful the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous confusing grimaces with acting last but not the least there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows   top notch cant wait to see more of the directors work  the author has only one review in imdb on 24 september 2004   incredibly shot amazingly intense  the author has only one review in imdb on 12 august 2004    not your typical blood and gore in fact better 710  the author has only one review in imdb on 13 february 2005   as intense as asian horror  the author has only one review in imdb on 14 november 2004  coincidence or are they the parents relatives friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap my vote is three  title brazil 1111  a nova profecia 1111  the new prophecy,0
i must give credit to billy dee for trying to pull this off knowing this was a blaxploitation film i started my dvd with a certain expectation i knew it would be low budget the acting subpar but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout if there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal or perhaps overacting as an actor and filmmaker i cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances yet i must admit i could not look away i dont know if this was like a car wreck you cant turn your eyes from or some mysterious power in the film that kept me there this film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong if walter kronkite were to tell the aristocrats joke it would be a total flop although the joke itself is hilarious let dave chappelle tell it and we are all rolling on the floor laughing this film needed a chapelle now with that said if you have the opportunity to purchase this film for the dollar that i did do it it is well worth the money perhaps i will take another dollar purchase the rights to this film and remake it who knows it might not be any better but it surely cant be any worse,0
this movie is absolutely terrible definately a bullt story and even worse acting too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies  the special effects are ateamstandard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood  of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say die evil americans  unless braindead movies are you game dont spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish pick up the platoon or apocalypse now instead,0
the violent death of fernando ramos da silva only eight years after the completion of this film only adds to the poignancy of dierector babencos powerful message the film is split into two halves  the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians the second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality which includes mugging pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives  the differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people particularly interesting is teh character of lalica a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children her reaction to the arrival of sueli a prostitute is both poignant and tragic   there is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in teh opening twenty minutes but whilst watching it it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale the actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streetsof sao paulo they actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da silvas case died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally a documentary a piece of fiction it borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it  1010,1
this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public this movie dramatizes that point a conservative whitecollar advertising company is taken over by a group of streetwise african americans chaired by a nononsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he conform rendering him no different than his predecessors interesting offbeat movie,1
believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious the basic story is about kintaro oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs chasing women and learning all he can about life kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made he takes everything to the extreme and its just laugh out loud funny every time from his constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters  one of the funniest things about this show is simply kintaros constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions he spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like dragon half or trigun other times in less then 01 seconds his face will turn not just serious but mangafighterstyle life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record its hilarious  if that wasnt enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldnt possibly be better kintaros english va is just perfect and will have you rolling around when hes not even really saying anything the one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an ecchi series it practically defines the word if youre an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like american pie youll love this   rirathcom,1
i loved that the mood was light and airy i loved that the lead character wanted guarantees about his future and that his roommate sets him straight of all people i loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the mens group dealt with each other considering this was directed by a lesbianthe whole theme of masculinity was put out there ridiculed dissected and questioned what makes a man what makes one straight gay or bisexual you arent really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants hes living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind these and other reasons make me love this film,1
i really like ryan reynolds and hope davis and i actually had high hopes watching this last night on dvd mainly as i try to avoid reviews until i watch something myself and form my own opinion big mistake my 2 10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 510 markonce it moved into tv reality show territory it stank to high heaven ryan reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay tv writer and famous games creator  devoted family man he was definitely less effective from the blurb on the box i expected a flashback thriller along the lines of memento  unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie,0
personally ive watched it because of lea thompsons appearance and i didnt really expect to enjoy the movie as such but surprisingly i kept watching it until the end  lets face it  it just one of the sagalike stories and isnt particularly original or entertaining but strangely it just keeps you by the tv my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldnt be one point that i just dont get  there is lovely and really touchy scene in which lea thompsons character is running on the street holding baby in her arms the snow is falling she is cold scared and has no place to stay she doesnt know what to do next and then about 1012 years later when things are better for her she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about  i just dont get it  i dont see how is it possible that she would do such thing it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival after this character flip i just couldnt enjoy rest of the movie,0
this show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors like the girl from boston legal and boris the butcher from snatch even the extras and the kid whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link surprised me with his skill its just the little things that the director needs to tweak like the guy who does the recap of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things but no where near as long as some shows like prison break anyone know when they will resume the season,1
one of the best movies ever the idea of a double interpretation involves we all   would be prot a schizophrenic or an et no doubt in my opinion but lets keep the question open kevin spacey the big screen monster plays prot as it should be done lets not forget jeff bridges and his great psychiatric   lastly a masterpiece that speakes for itself can keep our eyes wide open from the beginning to the credits and our minds thinking even when the movie is over if you still didnt watch it go right now and again again,1
as powerful as the true story of phoolan is this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from prison and had the chance to tell it   it is allegedly based on her diaries but she is illiterate how does that work   that said some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isnt bad with some sensitivity being shown   really though this story needs to be old in a tv series far to much happens to cram into a couple of hours   read her autobiography highly recommended it is a fantastic story,0
poor shirley maclaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish gaginducing feelgood movie but shes trampled by the runaway sentimentality of a film thats not the least bit grounded in reality  this was directed by curtis hanson did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy as evidenced by wonder boys so i dont know what happened to him here this is the kind of movie that doesnt want to accept that life is messy and fussy and that neat tidy endings however implausible they might be might make for a nice closing shot but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through  my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred  eg the old mans going to teach her to read and then drop dead bingo this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if theyre that aware of whats causing them toni collette a fine actress by the way and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them spelling out in flashing neon the films awkward connecting motif at that moment i knew what i was in for and the film was a downward spiral from there  grade c,0
this joins the endless line of corny predictable 50s scifi shlock out there as usual its pretty bad there isnt much of a plot that i could detect and the overexaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs the title is misleading also catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed and its better left that way,0
woa talk about awful do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first   i have to admit i didnt watch the whole thing it was just too horrible the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance   this would not even be good as a made for tv flick   ouch,0
a pigtailed linnea quigley drinks milk strips and kills her sister and her sisters boyfriend after they have sex she goes to an asylum makes a best friend out of amy karen russell and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists one is played by carol burnett show regular lyle waggoner on the outside these two manhating mafia princesses  stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball exboyfriends over to their large country home for a party where theyre systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved leatherclad mystery killer  the hideous david barton fx are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sortof surrealistic quality same goes for the movie the dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so otherworldly youll start to doubt your own sanity this film actually attempts to have a plot and threedimensional characters but its all so poorly handled its almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script and like any good bergman film this has a mature moral to abide byany good party needs a proper guygirl ratio so there will be enough chicks to tickle your lizard see it for yourself or dont  linnea the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eyepopping nude scenes unfortunately she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it  score 3 out of 10,0
it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores in fact i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it acting your kidding right direction no a plot no this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie this is often the case with movies of this genre but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth this movie is so empty that it cannot even suit that purpose i have to give this a 110 three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is no one should ever watch this for any reason again,0
this movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining radar and it is quite awhile before you ever see the deadly mantis probably a better movie in the 50s this dated piece is a bit to slow moving and the pay off in the end isnt very good though it has its moments like when the guy from perry mason argues with an old man and when he says i have narrowed the possibilities to one excuse me but when you narrow something down you have a couple or more possibilities not oneif you get it down to one you havent narrowed it down but you have in fact figured out what it is the monster is standard 50s scifi fair better than say the grasshoppers in the beginning of the end acting is subpar and the heroine is the most unattractivein fact in some shots she does look like a guy in drag you see plenty of fighter plane stock footage and other things but you wont see much at all of the deadly mantis,0
this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a bmovie before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but id never thought it could be this bad the title promises dracula in space and does deliver however the story makes no real use of the fact that casper van diens character is a descendant of van helsing and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast ive never seen an ending scream out and now were over budget in a clearer fashion their resolution of the movie was rather comic though the story had so obviously painted itself into a corner if you feel you have to see it watch it with a friend who shares your love of bmovies if i hadnt i wouldnt have made it to the end,0
this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at carnegie mellon university cmu at a 10 pm show there was a scheduled 1 am show after that but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 330 am the opening scene is of a man walking in a field and it lasts four minutes of movie time it is an ominous sign of whats to come a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall standing in the sun it is repeated 15 times with very sparse dialogue occasionally these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills such as a close up of female genitalia shown for one full minute of film time audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds as to say whats the message the story resembles dostoyevskys novel the karamazov brothers in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals in one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldnt see things clearly since the eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from english system to metric system to they couldnt see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it this was no film kitchen 8mm experiment it was carefully planned structured acted montaged yet i got so little out of it some comments indictated on the excruciating detail such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a door just opened okay it was noted but what was the purpose some corageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour the rest remained out of curiosity there must be something happening at the end there never was and maybe thats what the film is about all the movies at the theater are actionpacked this one wants to be different there is nothing happening,0
it starts off pretty well with the accident and the decision not to return to la but everything falls into place too quickly there is a decent plot twist towards the end but so many scenes that dont make sense randy played by brian austin green comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere i dont want to spoil it for anyone who does decide to see it but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous even the acting which wasnt bad early on turns bad towards the end dont bother unless you want to see how bad it is,0
when i was driving home after work i bought some movies for my four year old twins i had bought this movie my kids would enjoy i watched this with my children my 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up in this movie the dad acts like a tard my little ones would watch it every dayone day they threw away all our moviesi sold the omosis jones movie on ebay my grade f i rather be seen on the worst dress list  my kids now hate this dumb movie if gives the idea that germs can talk to each other i wonder how the dumb movie sounds in japenese i broke the cd in half when i got irritated of seeing it over and over again no offence but brandy  elenas acting was the best,0
this episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror so far this season masters of horror has produced one really good episodethe damned thingit is still early i have faith that the episodes will get better i admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline the episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring but the last fifteen minutes was really good though i am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first seasons episodes possessed please save this season john carpenter i have faith that prolife will redeem the entire lackluster season so far  youre an angry little elf,0
updating of the clare booth luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment the cast of women is excellent most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum granted the story of a woman dealing with her husbands infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common but at the same time its just as timely as ever i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really dont feel pulled along by the plot wait for cable,0
i am a huge fan of the original assault on precinct 13 the ice cream scene haunts me to this day im 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child when i heard they were remaking it i thought it might be good but when i saw the film its 100 not the same film its not a remake its a bad stolen idea it was completely ruined the cast maria bello laurence fishburne ethan hawke gabriel burne john leguizamo and drea de matteo are all great actors but even they couldnt save this film it was just wrong even the setting was completely opposite and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door why didnt help show up sooner stupid no sense,0
words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the subspecies themselveswhich were not executed well enough for a special effectso why do i glorify these movies for the herd of movie massconsumers out therewho care more about quantity than qualityabout cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesnt even deserve a capital letterunderworlddracula 2000dracula 3000 and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanaticon the other handis obvious the vampire himself is romanianthe story is set in transylvania the scenes filmed on location are more than convincingand the atmosphere is not based on any actionpacked chases or expensive orchestral musicradu himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romaniainclude some typical vampiric elements  such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in shortif like meyou re fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and darktheres no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie or in vampire journalsthe brilliant spin off of the former,1
during world war ii two byelorussian soviet russian soldiers try to avoid being captured by occupying nazis as they trudge through snowy terrain searching for food and safety if you happen not to like blackandwhite foreign films you may still enjoy voskhozhdeniye retiled in english the ascent director larisa shepitko paces the film extraordinarily well despite its being a largely introspective piece of work her untimely death in a car accident made this ms shepitkos final film unfortunately  after the opening mission is declared there doesnt seem to be much that could happen in the snowy woods but shepitko and a changing setting make it unexpectedly exciting leading players vladimir gostyukhin as the spiritually wounded rybak and boris plotnikov as the physically wounded sotnikov successfully avoid being crushed by the ever increasing symbolism their allegorical performances under shepitkos sharp direction provide a memorable and thoughtprovoking take on a familiar story   voskhozhdeniye 4277 larisa shepitko  vladimir gostyukhin boris plotnikov lyudmila polyakova anatoli solonitsyn,1
three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller its closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidmans grieving parents attempting to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zanes adrift psychokiller it provided sharp increasingly ratcheted suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded  three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesnt care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly overinflated by some sort of liferaft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoohexed manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood  no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse pun  plus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credible  im guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is its not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema,0
the story was well plotted and interesting by itself however it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you to avoid that i am not going to talking the story here  i regard this film as a good adaption of sarah waters book as compared with the previous one tipping the velvet i read the book first and then watched the dvd later the film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book of course due to the time limitation the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book therefore it couldnt illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of mr ibbss place and those after that even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story it really worth watching its still unclear when bbcamerica can broadcast this film thats pity  ps noticed that the ages of maud and sue were set to be 2021 instead of 1718 in the book the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses,1
the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the thenhusbandwife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers she has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer hes an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this woods jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed no matter what and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick she sings it for four or five or six minutes so you know its classic padding between commercials it also is one of the worst songs ever written and the woman doing woods singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery also keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses by comparison wagner looks relatively timeless with closecropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits,0
entrails of a beauty features a gang of yakuza blokes gangraping a woman and they drug herand later on she dies and returns as this big slimy monster with a huge penis that has sharp teeth and also a big sloppy vaginacrazy filmbut not very goodthe gore doesnt come until the last 20 minutes and most of the film is a standard soft core sex with lots of rapeworth checking outunfortunately heavily censored optically and nowhere near as much fun as entrails of a virgin,1
i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on ae ive been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid and love catching ghost hunters when its on scifi channel ive tried to watch three episodes of paranormal state and only use up my time commenting on it because its so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak paranormal state is beyond cheesy cheesy directors log voiceovers that will leave you wishing for captain kirk cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be evil and the work of a demonic spirit then come the exorcists demonologists psychics  like in poltergeist you almost expect the team to leave and say this house is clear i very much appreciate the ghost hunters approach where they go in to disprove claims then take away what they can  and they are almost always reassuring to the client if they find anything that haunted does not equal evil paranormal state is not so bad its good  its just plain bad didnt ae used to stand for arts  entertainment the art part has long been gone and the entertainment factor is now waning as well,0
jamie foxx was the epitome of ray charles after a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself ray charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that no one has ever or will ever write play or record music like this musical giant when he passed the flesh the world lost one of its greatest american heroes as far as the movie the fact that jamie foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like ray was an asset to the director what could be better than that you dont have to have a double play piano and then try to split the screen from someone elses hands to jamies face it worked beautifully i loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult ray was he wasnt always a nice man you didnt also root for him he was a drug addict a womanizer and sometimes just plain hardheaded but i guess thats what made him genius so i cant fault him for that i pick jamie for best actor,1
an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script inept direction and some of the worst score that i have ever heard more tv movie of the week than serious drama which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring in my opinion one the most blatant forms of cut and paste film adapting,0
this ones as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such at which ive never been any good in spite of my love of scifi movies that it didnt really matter anyway the bird  first depicted as a mere blurred form whizzing through the skies but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory  is so sublimely silly that it wouldnt be amiss in a looney tunes cartoon witness the series of intermittentlytaken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a sidesplitting extreme closeup of its face   director sears had fared much better with his other film about ufos the fine earth vs the flying saucers 1956  with special effects provided by a master ray harryhausen speaking of which ive just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring columbias recentlyreleased se dvd also it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the birds rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier scifi classic again the leads are played by genre regulars  namely jeff morrow from this island earth 1955 and mara corday from tarantula 1955 as with the aforementioned flying saucers these titles are highlyregarded and beloved by fans  consequently they are vastly superior to this lamentable addition to the alienmonster animal cycle prevalent during the scifi heyday and beyond incidentally other flying menaces were featured in the flying serpent 1946 which i havent watched and larry cohens tongueincheek updating of same in q the winged serpent 1982  unfortunately the giant claw cant even rise to a decent climax  which is so rushed as to be a washout to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective that is before morrow realizes that its shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to figure out a way how to be able to penetrate it ultimately apart from the intractable and frankly tedious technical asides one gets a feeling of so bad its good watching this after all it only lasts for 74 minutes  and in any case the bird is such an unforgettably daft creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up,0
as with many sequels this one just doesnt have the quality or the impact of the original the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats this one just doesnt cut it the first film had a magical good time feeling about it that is totally missing from this film we became enamored of all these characters minus richard dreyfuss in an age of innocence now a few years later they have changed so much that they are largely different people while this is what happens in real life we dont expect this to happen to our favorite film characters the film doesnt have the humor that the original had and we were expecting to laugh what little humor is there is dark the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever while this one is good but not even close to the originals this film is so totally different from the original that it isnt even actually a sequel i gave it a 4,0
there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden panattiere was subpar both in terms of acting and cheerleading there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film only great character kirresha,0
if you really loved gwtw you will find quite disappointing the story those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production altought i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett but let me say that considering the novel nothing good could came out of this  ive read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs mitchell did for the film it took me some time to understand how good the ending was scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett since she always got what she wanted but there was no kiss in the end  then alexandra ripley came to fix this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be and of course describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else nothing could have been further from mrs mitchell mind i am sure  the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending  if margaret mitchell could came to live again she would die one more time at the very moment shed find out what scarlett became after gwtw  sure its not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault isnt it is it any good if i dont compare it to the original maybe sorry to say i dont really care  i would expect little more compromise to continue someone elses suberb work otherwise dont even try,0
theres something intriguing about disaster movies the simple primal premise can lead to several great stories granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with that  unfortunately flood probably marks the low point in the history of this subgenre robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters he gives a barely decent performance as well joanne whalley is very uneven veteran actor tom courtenay he played in doctor zhivago for heavens sake is particularly bad i mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor what an embarrassing performance for that man the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception jessalyn gilsig whom i thought might be there as a plot deviceeye candy gives by far the most convincing performance doesnt mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared  the script is really bad confusing and clich some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the otheryouve seen this story a thousand times it employs every dramatic hook and tearjerkers youve seen in outbreak armageddon the poseidon movies original and remake and many others  the direction is awful no sense of timing nothing inspired the shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on rather poor cgi the human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done the madefortv feel gives nausea some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter no problem lets show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cutediting job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possible  the movie score is rather poor all over the place no timing  the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time very much like they ran out of ideas scrap that you cant run out of something if you never had it in the first place must have ran out of budget  this is a really amateur job i give it a 2 for using london as a location which is a nice change for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent those of the water closing in on london and the gates  do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one this includes older classics like the towering inferno,0
i was cast as the surfer dude in the beach scenes almost got cast as the muscle guy since the real muscle guy was really really late that day pauly had my brother and i the skateboarder in front of the tattoo place do some vj stuff in between takes live from venice since he was still doing his mtv thing this movie is really good as well would it have made my top 100 if i wasnt in it,1
possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic i dont think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to it is toilet humour at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes,0
the ateam is still repeating every day on dutch television rtl7 around 1800hrs and i still watch it i dont like the ateam i absolutely adore them it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of ateam brings back memories from the old days when i was young an sweet i would have given you a 10 for excellent but justin looks like he is chasing the former ateam members all by himself of course that is the only bad thing on this documentary too bad justin does not look for melinda culea amy a allen but it is great to see mr t back into action too bad for him he does not show up at the party at the end but that party is too short to laugh again and to see everybody in action again,1
if this film was just outrageously poor would be fine the problem is many take it seriously to make it short a few points    there is no story no focus no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer overall the film is extremely repetitive and boring i have been in wartorn african countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense   questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements   i am no doc filmmaker but whats the point in raising for example the question of weapon smuggling if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporters statement the director doesnt even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed   the story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference did this guy do any work at all    abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but wheres the point one can go almost anywhere in africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately wheres the big news    filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real tv   the parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically antiglobalization and antiwestern feelings  there is an interesting debate in france after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film which brought number of journalists working in africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details it turns out that    the fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animalfeeding purposes i think i am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite   arm smuggling is a reality but there again wheres the big news but not the way this film explains the issue if the empty planes landing in mwanza do participate in smuggling they actually unload their shipment in a different location in africa then go to mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty meaning that they do actually land empty in mwanza   people do eat fish locally contrary to what the film suggest around 4060 of what is taken out of the lake and thousands of people make their living with it good for them its private business of that kind that will one day take african countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance  i cannot tell how shocked i am seeing the success of this film,0
i loved all dogs go to heaven so much that i went to see the sequel in the theater and i cant remember being more disappointed by a movie the story stank worse than an overaged sack of manure i mean come on how could carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him no matter how angry he was plus depicting satan as a cat how clich can you get so much for the story is it any wonder that don bluth burt reynolds melba moore and vic tayback wouldnt touch it with a 10 foot pole the animation was absolutely wretched the colors were all washed out and i cant count how many times i was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid it had to be the worst animation ive ever seen i usually like animated movies but not this bomb,0
most awful casting ive ever seen clark kent as a crack head a very feminine looking woman as a trans and on and on  stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent no content no meaning this person has never been on the streets its a joke  the only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that i finished watching it i just kept thinking it couldnt get any worse but it did to the very end  trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie trying to be freaky so stupid i really have no more to say but cant leave a comment unless i write more  please take this advice and do not bother watching this movie awful,0
if hollywood had the wellbeing of the audience at heart we would see 20 films a year with the kind of wholesome fortitude that is behind this film there are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human even the lessons learned are not that greed will profit you or dountootherswhateveryouwantaslongasyouareokaywithit no this is what our sad desensitized lives need more sense more love more dountoothersasyouwouldhavedoneuntoyou more hope thanks ursula this movie has an intelligent wit not yo mama cracks that run rampant in the socalled comedies people need to feel good this movie will make you feel good and possibly inspire you to better your life and the lives of others sidenote every person counts in ticket sales this is a truly independent film if you want more quality films you have to support them,1
the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously overdramatized and every cliche in the book on womens suffering in india has been overused to the max,0
now any blaxploiation fan will recognise the ingredients big afros topless babes surreally bad fashions and some jive talk in this case add in a lead who cant act a plot that makes little sense editing by someone with no hands who has been blindfolded and the most godawful fight scenes and you have tnt jackson not quite bad enough to be good but not good enough to be bad this is a wonderful mess from start to finish i especially loved the endless continuity errors and the leads white stunt double  this is so 70s bad far eastern martial arts meets black power that it hurts but boy it hurts so good i am ashamed to admit that i almost enjoyed it,0
as i sit here i find myself laughing at certain moments in this film go and see this film  if youve ever been clubbing go and see this film  if youve ever wanted to go clubbing go and see this film  my bet is that the film was borne from an idea whilst out clubbing and this is the product of that oneinamillion chance that someone remembered it in the morning and had the application to follow it through  in summary then go and see this film,1
all in all an excellent movie from that time and source coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii provided you dont take it at all seriously the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say jfk this one may actually be more honest about it though as it essentially admits along the way that its not to be taken as particularly factbased but more of a stylishly semiheroic portrayal its worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today the ny times review conceded that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film described the biographical account of custers life as fanciful and pointed out that the presentation of custers motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts they could have really gone overboard in building up custer one supposes but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around but appropriately determined principled and inspirational  flynn and dehavilland doing their 8th movie together in 7 years and their last are so comfortable together and play off each other so easily at this point that its not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here with a firsttime pairing it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer but these two make it work the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together the greatly underrated michael curtiz but given that he had worked with them on the previous years similarthemed santa fe trail its understandable if he chose to opt out of this one they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade  both terrific  so we cant really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh  raoul walsh the director here is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences  which are outstanding  and everything else outdoors the interior scenes are a little more uneven but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well as does warner bros outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces greenstreet gene lockhart anthony quinn arthur kennedy etc i would have liked it better if kennedys character had been a bit less standard i generally like his work but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene the part could have been better written  and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle as hed only been in films for one year walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together  various highlights include the depiction probably imagined of the genesis of garryowen as the cavalry theme the last half hour is particularly outstanding especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventure  8 of 10,1
a rather lame teen slasher from brisbane while the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden the problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devilmaycare it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really in fact i only started enjoying the film when i started wishing for their death one of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police i realise we wouldnt have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldnt avoid,0
i couldnt help but relish the entire premise of cat in the brain because it dutifully explains a directors steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past director fulci playing himself is directing ghosts of sodomand can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder he seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses fulcis work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps hes responsible  this is obviously a film playfully poking fun at fulcis image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy the film features pretty much a wraparound story surrounding nonstop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct or probably want to the films savagery compliments the mental state of fulcis fulcii knowduring the running time reality and cinematic fiction have fused and fulci can find no escape the endingexplaining the old clichits only a moviecouldnt work any better than it does here fulcis boat says perversionexcellent touchand he sails offi can only wish this was his final film because thats a perfect close if there ever was one david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife jeoffrey kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend  the ultraviolence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet the most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieceshow a gardeners chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequencethe most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated the opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on fulcis brain is a howler the scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified fulci looking on are obvious but i couldnt help but enjoy this anyway,1
dull acting weak scriptworst spanish movie in yearsi was  attracted by the naked beauty of paz vega but as an actress  shes useless you almost cant understand what shes saying  about the story theres not much coherent to saywe heard of it  before but as this is a modern carmen we find a few changes the french soldier is now a basque soldier merimee himself is a character in the story carmen is a dangerous bandolera in love with a famous  matador and she can speak fluent basque  can anyone understand this mess,0
this film looks great and thats about where my praise ends love is a many splendored thing came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955 when candycoloured nonsense like this coexisted with trailblazing artistic fair like kiss me deadly as a trend toward smaller socially conscious films like on the waterfront and marty established itself in the mid50s other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade and love is one of the latter  this is the kind of 50s movie where the technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably highkey even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day i never want to hear the theme song again as its played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime and i certainly dont want to hear it sung by the shrill earpiercing choir that belts it out over the end titles jennifer jones and william holden are passable but really anybody could have played these parts jones role is horribly writtenher character is incredibly inconsistent and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be  people will undoubtedly tell me im taking this film too seriously that im unromantic etc but i loved all that heaven allows released the same year and just as cornball in its own way except that douglas sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form whereas henry king director of love is not  im usually able to enjoy bad melodrama but in this case i was just bored  grade d,0
at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button surprisingly the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to i scored this movie at 7 but like most would felt it should be a 10 you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects twists and turns etc this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an alabama style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done,1
this movie gives golf a high mark it was well acted and well directed giving you a view of history that some nonsports fans will enjoy the historic factor alone gives it a high rating the brookline golf course was really done well i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan and as someone who loves the game the movie was well done on all levels a must see 5 stars the acting was superb disney has another winner in its bag of great movies if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life i would tell you that the setting while in the late 1800s and early 1900s is very realistic the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film a must see for fans and nonfans alike,1
its certainly a directtovideo but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think i quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time  the heros reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human the hopper character is actually playing god that might be the right thing to do but one may not like that anyway  in the end the god player is doomed to death and the hero who would have spent his own life can live quite a morale   the most unrealistic thing i saw is that earth is doing so well with no moon stabilizing its rotation,0
in new york in a morning close to christmas an upper class father and mother go in their bmw to a private school to see the play of their daughter then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in manhattan in the night they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they prepare drugs for distribution on the christmas eve while buying the christmas gift for their daughter the father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom r xmas is a deceptive movie of abel ferrara the lead characters do not have names are anonymous and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons or that there are many dirty cops probably worse than the criminals or is it a simple apology to crime whatever however this humanization of criminals is a horrible message and i really did not like this movie in brazil for example many drug dealers and criminals help their communities due to the absence of the state in poor areas and slums but this procedure does not make them model citizen in this movie we see a loving upper class family in the day providing drugs as means of living but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters in the end i wished all of them dead my vote is four  title brazil gangues do gueto gangs of the ghetto,0
some sort of accolades must be given to hellraiser bloodline its actually out fullmooned full moon it bears all the marks of say your demonic toys or puppet master series without their dopey uh charm full moon can get away with silly product because they know its silly these hellraiser things man do they ever take themselves seriously this increasingly stupid franchise though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it once made up for its low budgets by being stylish now its just ish,0
this movie starts really good  after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap  some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ  or you go to hell  dont watch it  its pure propaganda and its pure wrong   this movie starts really good  after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap  some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ  or you go to hell  dont watch it  its pure propaganda and its pure wrong,0

this movie may bear some historical importance and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together the setting the rocket the space suits the surface of the moon all scream a classic  but in the end the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis but bear too little entertainment value many times  much of this movie seems like a good movie for nineyearolds the mature themes the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as well  the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in 2001 but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie and has star wars not somehow modelled its spacescrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film but then again  the inheritance is marginal  if its a real groundbreaking and megainfluential mature 1950ies scifi classic you are looking for however check out forbidden planet,0
recycled and predictable plot the characters are as memorable as the story line we came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old overall a disappointment,0
i saw this movie a few years ago and man i never want to golf again i mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved and im not talking about victimless stuff like forging a scorecard no no based on what ive seen here they shamelessly massacre policemen and golfers alike on hallowed country club grounds judge smailes would be spinning in his grave and do they repent for said sins no no based on what i have seen here the typical response by a slain ninja is to take over the body of a buxom female telephone repairwoman and seek revenge i find this morally reprehensible and needless to say after viewing this nonsense i not only stopped golfing and talking on the telephone but also decided to stop feeding the homeless,0
this film is more than the story of danton it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system it probably helped spur the solidarity movements union activity it is more about poland in the 20th century than the french revolution solidarity began the end of the system this film itself is historical by its very existencethe rest is history  robspiere aka totalitarian leaders danton aka walensa when one watches this film one must remember the snowball which began in poland   actually it could be useful for seeing the superpower struggle within the only superpower left,1
technically iam a van damme fan or i was this movie is so bad that i hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes do not let the name isaac florentine undisputed ii fool you i had big hopes for this one depending on what i saw in undisputed ii man was i wrong  all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero but i guess we wont be able to see that soon as our hero keep coming with those going toaborder  farawaytownand kill thebadguys thancomeback home movies i mean for gods sake we are in 2008 and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level why  do your self a favor skip it seriously,0
this was so bad i cant even review it so ill jot some sentences about what i witnessed and itll be up to you to decide   captain kirk with toupee and tubby gut is rock climbing yosemetes el capitan spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboardlike hovercraft kirk falls spock flies down catches him inches before kirk hits the ground head first   later that night spock kirk and mccoy are eating beans around a campfire spock likes the beans then kirk and mccoy sing row row row your boat and want spock to join in on the threeway harmony spock doesnt want to sing and later that night he disagrees but life isnt but a dream captain should i go on   okay a renegade vulcan who happens to be spocks half brother leads a revolt on a sandy planet  taking hostages the crew of the enterprise land on the planet and uhura pushing fiftyfive and weighing twohundred someodd pounds lures the natives with her bare legs but they cant trick the brother who claims he can find god   he kidnaps the crew and the enterprise they go to a planet where a big bearded apparition claiming to be god spits fire at kirk spock and mccoy spocks sibling realizing it isnt god  but is really a form of himself  or something  joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and sparks fly   then after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving klingons who resemble lorenzo lamas   the three amigos  kirk spock and mccoy  return to yosemite did i mention kirk was wearing a go climb a rock tshirt with spock playing some kind of funky vulcan guitar they sing row row row your boat this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll,0
well i have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face ok but that does not make it a good movie most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing not all of them give great acting performances but some really try but fail because their characters are badly written the perfect example is julia koschitz she changes her eating habits from one talk to the other on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne she feels too beautiful for most people in fact she is but still ends up with the perfect fit concerning the looks and refuses to give some more realistic guys a chance and so on the end is very cheesy although i like one of the final scenes when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters mostly because it is about sex and relationships i assume and maybe some short entertainment still the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it,0
where to begin i like the scary snowmonster named jack frost the whole concept works well for me we thought hed be back and he was changing the local to a tropical resort works seeing old friends and meeting new characters scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance yup jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first i do have one complaint the little jacks or the jacklings as i call them they looked like hand puppets i think they could have done a better job with the jacklings the mouth could have opened wider but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again if you liked jack frost then you will like this sequel no questions or debate 9 big stars,1
with a title like that you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter goya then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic inquisition with even more latitude perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period with lurid characterisation too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact milos forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic rambling mishmash that fails on all three accounts  milos forman who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps is the great director who painted the artist mozart as a buffoon and got away with it won awards for it in fact his life in czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse repellent regimes especially communism he also made the equally overthetop but rather impressive one flew over the cuckoos nest so at the age of 74 how does he come to offer us this mess in goyas ghosts goya is one step removed from buffoon the main character is brother lorenzo passionately acted by javier bardem natalie portman is equally vibrant as goyas model ines and later in the film her own daughter the tenuous connection with goya is that he happens to paint both of them  lorenzo tortures and then rapes ines who he suspects of being a jew her father tortures lorenzo napoleon dashes in to liberate spain briefly ines gets out of the dungeon the church has left her in and searches for her child goya is still painting but has gone deaf his main preoccupation seems to be helping ines and so on  historically goya was also a historian as forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of goya the painter this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together  a large slice of history as seen by goya but the painter is too tangential to receive any weight similarly a document of the terrors of the inquisition should be done  compared to other despotic orders throughout time the holy see has been forgiven with barely a confession though one might ask if forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything  i thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story he says in the production notes there were a great many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the spanish inquisition but the story is too tenuous to hold our attention against our expectations and with a background of something major the life of a great painter the horrors of the inquisition and even the french revolution we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted if kind infatuation of goyas the result is that we feel cheated  background detail is appallingly handled goya went deaf in 1792 when the film starts not 15 years later napoleon is as believable as a cutout from a cereal packet we see the church passing out a death sentence when the normal procedure was for the church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work battles look overlychoreographed and stagey a peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it  on the positive side the production values are mostly good the colours are vivid the pacing excellent at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline bardem is excellent and portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman while it doesnt say very much about goya what it does say is nice even if superficial and pretty irrelevant  i once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and i asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life who would it be on his record forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list,0
man i remember this show with nostalgic i really dug bravestarr because he wasnt the conventional hero he was more than a futuristic texas cowboy the man had the strenght of a bear the vision of a walk and the agility of a  i cant remember that one  the action sequences were great i remember that bravestarr would always use his bazooka named sarajuana translated to spanish anytime he was in big troubles  this was a quality action cartoon i loved the characters the dialogs the music and of course the opening credits sequence bravestarr long live to him a cult classic in my opinion and a must see,1
alfred hitchcocks saboteur is not one of his bestregarded films made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures suspicion and shadow of a doubt its generally regarded as a lesser effort i agree that the later film is groundbreaking drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players bob cummings and priscilla lane  in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america literally as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused cummings is very youthful here and quite engaging his boyishness but not immaturity perfectly suits the character he is portraying and seems appropriate as the director though middleaged was in the process of reinventing himself and an older more established star might have thrown things off priscilla lanes spunky heroine which not a typical type for the director was very much a common type in american films at the time and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time i cannot imagine older more solid typescooper and stanwyck for instancedoing any better as they would have between them carried well too much baggage  as is the norm in hitchcocks films nothing is as it appears where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early though cummings is an accused arsonist we know that he is innocent the villains become apparent fairly soon and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies what pleasures there are are incidental and here the master does not disappoint there is an interesting tod browningish interlude with some circus freaks who help cummings elude capture in another scene reminiscent of james whales bride of frankenstein cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man who as it turns out is lanes uncle was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade whatever the case these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety which when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man still learning his craft  the films later scenes in new york are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the picture gradually becomes more hitchockian as it moves along in the end i find it a satisfying work and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor neither does the movie have one it is deliberately lightweight and i suspect semiexperimental an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off in an american setting the sort of story he had done so well in england he succeeded admirably the next logical step shadow of a doubt a film in which the main character travels east to west and with a wholly different set of values and plans,1
ravi chopra wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast dilip kumar in the lead  the film finally was rewritten and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times  like the reason amitabhhema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like gulshan in avtaar  the message though comes well but things are presented in a clichd manner salmans character is the worst looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good  ravi chopra does a good job music is decent the songs sung by bachchan stand out  amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well his last speech is great hema is good in her part aman verma stands out samir soni is okay naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though divya dutta stands out salman khan is fake mahima is okay paresh and lillete are lovable,0
i was a little to old for this show i was 6 when it first came out first off when i was a young child there were a few childrens shows that were on sesame street which i did watch and learned from but other than that there wasnt much else my cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter barney was a very big part of what they watched when i first saw this show i told my grandmother how it doesnt teach anything just uses magic to fix everything i was 9 at the time how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a tv show more and more that i saw or heard what the teachings of barney were the more and more i told people how bad the show was the funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80s which was me by the way they agreed and said the same thing as i did the sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw its not cheating its creative its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to its ok to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone lets be honest with ourselves barney is out to make money not teach children anything the more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better second barney put on a show and parents bought it i never believed that tv could affect people the way barney does if you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers do not let them get involved in this show barney is like smoking once is to much smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought,0
i really love this movie  i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldnt order it so i just today thought i would look and then i found it they put it out in spain on dvd under the name algo mas que amigos and you can buy there it is in english and spanish on the dvdhope this helps  i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they havent released to the us market best of luckoh for more info here is one place to look httpwwwzonadvdcom i think it going for 10 dollars usd on ebay as well,1
a friend brought me this movie and at first i was hesitating the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning but the life scenes were attractive its like observing than watching   it turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming its like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie   mr alejandro polanco and miss isamar gonzales did their roles so well that its more like telling us their own stories indeed they used their real names in the movie,1
i only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago yet its impact has never left me and i can still remember even now my reactions to iti was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography i was astounded that an american studio could produce such a european film with its slow pace and its unfocused plot the lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but i raged at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the pictureit was also refreshing to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the american dreamthe western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which prefigured the recent deadwood seriesthe film was massively cut for the american audience and its my very real wish that in these days of directors cuts that michael cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection  a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become i have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sensealthough christopher walken is responsible mainly for carrying this off if only de niro and not kris kristofferson had played the main leadthere was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script nevertheless the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe you were inside the action yourselfand there were many special moments everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some unity of action in face of the impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties facing the welding together of the usa especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and moneynates faltering approach to ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one i had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it whilst having varying reservationsthis revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for americans to take when the film was first released but we all felt it had enormous merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major revision,1
actually im still in doubt if theres anything about this movie i like as for the story unrealistic and very exaggerated the acting was too bad in my opinion not very likely that antonie kamerling will get a rutger hauer status some folks will expect it anyway first let him work on his english pronunciation if you watch the trip to paris of these actors dvdextra you will most likely want to trow up advice to beau dorens stop your acting career youll never get there to the 2 main actors grow up please being generous id give it 4 out of 10,0
like another poster mentioned ch 56 a local boston tv station showed this multiple times over the years on saturday afternoons they paired it with the first sequel return of the ginat majin  now i havent seen it since thenbut it never left me aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy technically it isnt horroruntil the statue comes to life at the end its just about a village ruled over by an evil man theres a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help themto no avail but things go too far the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guysbut then it starts going after the good guys too welldone with some cool special effects at the end loved how he got rid of the main bad guy also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too  no masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasyhorror film worth catchingbut not if its the dubbed print,1
i remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it i happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age first of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which i would term actionhorror as opposed to psychological horror such as the shining or the exorcist  furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods or in this instance bad the film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door the film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have if you compare nod to contemporary big budget horror films such as i am legend the vincent price version was much better this film really stands out modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by cgi most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable the special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic if this is 80s horror cheese ill take it over 95 of current entries in the genre  on a closing note seeing nod again made me remember the beautiful jill terashita and wonder why i have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise jill on the odd chance that you read this i think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films lastly if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot,1
i saw the film many times and every time i am more and more disappointedwhich is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good the shame here is that holiwood tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea my self coming from the balkansmacedonia found this film disappointingsimply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu you need to know their background way of live what makes them cry and laughand the director of the film didnt took that as guideline when weex yu make films lots of symbolism is build in it which makes the characters recognisable and likable and mostly portraying the truthif it is based on true story the films like pritty village pretty flame tito and me undergroundno mans land before the rainblack cat white catotac na sluzbenom putuwhen father was away on businessko to tamo pevawho sings over thererare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematographyand nothing can compare to it not the half baked story of and holiwood studio as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too and to add insult to the injury half of the things are shoot in bitola macedonia where i come from imagen my shock when i saw the broad st of bitola in the opening scene of the film when the bride is shoot from the sniperand what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film anyway very disappointing as the truth is far away from the film shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire before they shoot the film book is one thing and real life is other and this film lets down both,0
chris penn is hilarious as the alltime stoner brother of jeff spicoli this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge this movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong fast times was more depressing than funny abortions friends cheating on friends jerking off in bathrooms bad jobs and failing school someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle schocked in the liquor store or ben stein in his first role in the sunnys surplus store,1
right the hospital scene with holly and shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with piper on a gurney looking very badly injured the docs race her into a resuscitation room  they move her from the gurney onto a bed and prue holds her hand from that point on it is obvious that piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing as she turns to beg of prue to not leave her side she gaps dont go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest  the monitor shows a clear flat line  the nurses go into full out trauma mode  bring in a defibrillator prue steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls,1
okay pretty good doesnt scream rent me but i was surprised at how much i enjoyed campfire tales while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is the scares dont just jump out at you but instead the directors build steadily to the climatic moments the film is based upon popular urban legends and ghost stories the writers have updated the tales rather well and twisted them just enough that the familiar endings still pack a punch the best of the shorts are the honeymoon and people can lick too i enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story the locket was a good ghost story and the wrap around the campfire is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the end the only disappointing segment is the hook which is fine because its pretty short anyway overall i give this a 7 out of 10 it has suspense which is lacking from most horror movies today and good acting by the cast it may not rate up there with halloween and the exorcist but its a good little movie well worth the price of a rental,1
book ii isnt a film its a sermon this nauseating sickly and almost unbearably tedious misfire probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few wisecracks from george burns louanne plays a little girl who is asked by ahem god to mount an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again no really that is the story its a leaden load of old cobblers that has far too much selfjustifying explanatory religious waffle but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm miracle on 34th street this aint suzanne pleshette breathes a bit of life into this rancid puddle of quicksetting concrete but the puddingheaded script and rubbish performance by the irksome louanne quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of youknowwhere,0
everyone told me this movie was downright not good and sick etc so i finally rented it and i was amazed  i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it i wouldnt call it a horror movie maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs andor kiss the girls it did get stupid at times but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat 710  rated r  for strong torture violence language and sexuality,1
the title tells it all  ed gein the butcher of plainfield  its not a zappy actionfilled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks that would fit it into a wellestablished genre the kind that some people find entertaining something along the lines of halloween or the texas chain saw massacre  this is dark slow filled with choppedup corpses and quietly evil there are few shock cuts no monsters pointofview shots no loud electronic score i dont know who its aimed at  ghouls maybe  beneath the credits we already see still photos of skulls carcasses hung up skins draped across the backs of chairs that sort of thing and theyre sufficiently revolting that i couldnt help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this grand guignol opening  alas its not the acting is uniformly terrible as in a high school play the script does its best to sink below vulgarity ed gein who killed only two middleaged women and maybe his brother chases a screaming bloody young woman through the woodland of weir and shes wearing only a modern bra and bikini rather than period underwear gein also decapitates a night watchman which he never did in any historical sense  the direction you could do a better job in the first few minutes law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield there is no body the handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim who may still be in the vicinity and living the sheriff lacking any motivation shouts at him now you just forget that i dont want you going off half cocked on anything it should be no more than a businesslike exchange of views why does the director have the sheriff so angry characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs  louis armstrongs aint misbehaving for instance this is  what  rural wisconsin in the 1950s and the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the cotton club in harlem in the 30s or new york intellectuals like woody allen nope the radio would be playing kitty kallens wheel of fortune or theresa brewer or equally likely lefty frizell not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of whats going on beneath the images someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs thats all  of course theres only so much you can do with a low budget but it can be light years ahead of this butchery see ed gein with steven railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies and on a budget that couldnt have exceeded this one by much  these comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie thats about as far as i could get if anyone finds this tale to be wellexecuted and fascinating in any way he should try to find some insight into his tastes its beneath mine  and i consider myself pretty warped,0
i think josh duhamel is so great the rest of the show is fun to watch but i think it is the handsome and sexy josh duhamel that makes the show las vegas really fun to see in the days of magnum i loved tom selleck i thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth a hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment i would have done anything to win a date with tad hamilton josh duhamel is incredible and i will always have a super crush on him josh is definitely a hunk and i will watch las vegas all the time josh duhamel is a big reason why too,1
critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever watchers also claim the same but there is a flip side to that coin they are wrong very wrong its the most clever film ive seen in ages  from beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic a story that reflexes the real world this film is like a mirror you see yourself in another way that people see you to really understand the directors point of view you have to see it another time  when you see this filmtry to understand the story and watch the backgroundlisten to the lyrics of the musicand smell the industrial complexes  this film is one of a kind youll hate itmost people do or youll love itand understand it completely  ernest hemmingway once saidthe world is a fine place and worth fighting for i agree with the second part,1
you know those films that are blatantly awful but you cant help but love them well thats what evil ed is possibly the best awful film in the world the sound is rubbish the dubbing is crap the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are pap however i cant help but love this film dearly and i have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years sam campbell or the guy who plays him should be featured on the actors studio series as he is that memorable possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana seriously if you dont expect a lot then you wont be disappointed keep a lighthearted approach to watching this film and youll soon rate it a ten afterwards,1
we still really love the movie and soundtrack valley girl i have owned it on video for eons and wore out the original soundtrack i have several friends with whom i get together and we have 80s raves  parties where we get together and play 80s music and run valley girl on the big screen  and were all in our 30s now we have an awesome time  its all in good fun like ya know,1
i love stephen kings work and the book was great but i was very disappointed when i bought this movie on dvd this was one of the worst bmovies i have ever seen it feels like they had a tight schedule and only took one shot at every scene even if it turned out to be a bad one and where did they find the actors,0
i dont go for that many heist comedies and i might not care for this one if it werent for the actors when it was made and when i first saw it just a few years later its almost too similar to the happening even though its obviously a much less serious comedy than that one  mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping or rather turns it in a different direction altogether of course raquel welch didnt play the kind of sharp character faye dunaway did in the happening but that doesnt make it a sexist film either  she was practically playing a stock character almost her version of a moll but im completely biased  its among the first films i ever saw with her and at the time i saw it you couldnt turn around without seeing a poster of her luckily i think robert wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor dislikable leader of the group as were edward g robinson naturally and vittoria de sica and godfrey cambridge an actor who always managed to be funny,1
most of the films i really like are arthouse fare and seldom appear on the boxoffice topten lists that said i found northfork utterly incomprehensible i have no idea what it was even about writing in the new york times about a different film stephen holden once observed that some people seem to think they can throw just anything up on the screen and have it work as a fairy tale i thought of that review several times while watching northfork  on a scale of one to ten i gave it a two,0
the creature yeah it and the movie it stars in hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to the shadowy world from which it came other than having major logic and coherence problems plus the fact it appears to be unfinished this disaster is terribly acted written edited by jr bookwalter and directed and the makeup fx are almost nonexistent its also significantly shorter than it claims at only 80 minutes but im not complaining its the worst movie ive seen from executive producer charles bands full moon productions and boy is that bad  to note i almost didnt bother with a review but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and i figured a varying opinion was in order proceed with caution,0
on this site ive often lambasted the americans for not knowing how to write comedy but while theyve never produced anything of the quality of fawlty towers blackadder or the fall and rise of reginald perrin they have also never to my knowledge made anything as bad as this the nadir of british comedy  on my richter scale of comic awfulness it rates only behind the truly execrable are you being served as the worst comedy show in the english language with bad acting annoying characters and humour that id grown out of before i left primary school unfortunately it was part of a large crop of shows back then along with dads army it aint half hot mum and allo allo that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catchphrases to keep audiences amused  michael crawford proved later on that hes a talented performer but personally id rather be sentenced to a month of watching rhoda than endure a single episode of this drivel which makes me ashamed to be british,0
in terms of quality movies this isnt one of them its actually the first chuck norris movie ive seen and i was left pretty underwhelmed the fight scenes are slow and dont have a lot of variety norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring the movie also is quite short but for some reason the movie doesnt even seem finished when it ends its a pretty anticlimatic ending all the same though ive watched a lot of bad movies and this isnt one of the worst that ive seen its worth a watch im guessing especially for norris fans theres also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie,0
the captain and tennille have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been hacked to bits the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to verify that suspicion ive noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information ive found on the net ive been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd whatever the truth may be im very appreciative of the efforts made by the production company i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which werent included hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras i recommend this dvd to any ct fan,1
after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it i think this is the worst comedy i ever seenever if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap not funny at all ok one or two laugh maybebut you have to be really high the acting is terrible and the story doesnt exist even if you like snowboarding  and i really do you will hate this movie ok ok you can see some nice babes  some nice snowboarding tricks and some beautiful mountains but thats all watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awfulbut this one believe meis pure trash dont waste your time and money in this one,0
i saw this movie on a night i couldnt sleep i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again probably the best movie i have ever seen at the time and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of nyc this is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing pleasure because you see it hear it and feel it from the moment i saw wirey drinking a beer and watching the game i imagined what it must be like to grow up without a father there are so many lines from this movie i use on a daily basis like the personal alone time in the bathroom drinking a 711 beverage great film,1
this review has been written by someone who has read it several times and knows what they are talking about firstly i have read others comments and noticed that some of the objections were really quite stupid people who have read the book and other jane austens or for that matter any good book will know that sticking to the book is vital you have to trust an author with what they do if the viewer does not like it because it sticks to the book well it shows they do not understand jane austen and obviously are not a true fan  firstly if the viewer truly loved the book or jane austen in general watching it for four hours should not prove difficult secondly their society did care a lot for looks and so big fancy hair styles would show off how rich you were which in their day was a key factor for getting along in good society i have to confess the female costumes were not brilliant but there were only a few bad ones and the males made up for it also this prejudice for the naval men not in their uniform is in nice words very silly today people do not go out with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century also as it goes the acting is very good it is subtle because that is how jayne austen writes and the scene at the end is beautiful you can not compare the filming to that of the 1995 version as technology has improved so much since them it is ridiculous to compare them in that the actress who plays ann is too old but her air of acting and how she does it makes up for it  people seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that i can not comprehend it does not stick to the book at all and so is flat the ending is sentimental they change major scenes the only good actors are the leads and they i give you did a good job for what was given to them obviously the people who really really like it are i am sorry stupid as they do not understand persuasion and so need it to be overdone the 1971 version is beautiful romantic was written by an excellent script writer same who did inspector morse had very good actors and really it is a film you can watch many times and during each you can be delighted with it,1
a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond its initial liftoff based on a true story  one of the many small stories prior to ww ii  that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon viewed at the stony brook film festival the film was enthusiastically received  well written and expertly cast the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations,1
this has to be the ultimate chick flick ever we taped it off the tv years ago and ive watched it about 30 times over the years i hadnt seen it for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie im not lying i cried from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie truly tears your heart out even if you dont have children,1
because mr bean almost never speaks i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over the pauseplay button at the end of any age groups lesson simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the dvd encouraging students to shout out the answers to whats this what will happen whats happening whats wrong or any other question that elicits responses from that lessons new vocabulary and grammar  because everyones looking at the tv normally shy students become vocal because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point its a perfect filler for the awkward between times while students are leaving and arriving  i tried other dvds notably tom  jerry cartoons and red skelton dvds but no others were as good as mister bean at holding students constant attention,1
this has got to be the best movie ive seen you definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists im no fan of george clooney but he shines here the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john turturro as pete and delmar one of the few movies that i own,1
i always hated this retarded show i liked the shows of cartoon network like dexters laboratory  or megas xlr but i never liked this piece of turd  basically because it have stupid characters the good or the villains all seems to be mentally retarded  they have stupid voices specially bubbles she is supposed to be the cute  character of the show but she is incredibly annoying  the story lines are very very stupid  some episodes could have been interesting but almost always the show turns childish and corny  there wasnt any likable character the music was horrible and the animation is the worst that ive seen  evena five year old boy could draw better  i dont see why all the world seems to love this piece of garbage  the powerpuff girls  seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made  fortunately foster home for the imaginary friends  from the same creator was far away better,0
nothing really unpredictable in this movie but a solid flick in all respects everything from acting to cinematography was solid not a perfectly linear plot line but there wasnt anything you couldnt see coming perhaps a tad melodramatic at points but again a fairly decent movie none the less definitely worth checking out if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend give this a go though you may not feel like running out and buying it i found it to be quite worth while,1
i dont know where most of you were at but where i watched the film we didnt have people singing as some have told they experienced we had people laughing mostly at the campy plot line the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of brosnan the only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs i was a dj in the seventies and even went to the abba concert at northlands coliseum in edmonton in sept of 79 so i did appreciate them then and i still do now but this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce the sequences were so poorly staged the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be meryls worst production i cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage so save your money wait for it to come out on dvd and then maybe spend your money on something better like cat litter,0
i really enjoyed this film im not usually one for fairy tales or make believe storeys but this film captured my attention  i first saw this film on the uk channel hallmarkwhich usually shows afew tacky filmsbut then snow queen came alongand i was loving it i really really admire bridget fonda in this movieshe plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously  i wont explain what the story is about as other people have already done so so there is no point repeating  i would just suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairy tale journeyget this filmbut if you want to purchase it and you live in the uk you might have a hard time ive bought it from south korea brand new english edition of course,1
this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen  i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was normally bad movies are no big deal but something about this one if you hated it you really hate it  if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one i guess not,0
this really is a movie that you need to see twice when i first saw this film i was really drawn into the story while the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room the stories that buddy nick drake wonderful allusion and daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels the soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly dark lofi and intriguing when you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending i have seen in a long time i hope to see this movie find a distributor for the dvd so that it will be more accessible great movie you wont be disappointed,1
garden state is another of these indietype pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real truetolife human drama oddly enough the production is very good so are the performances by some fairly bigname actors as well where the picture is lacking is in zach braffs script which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies  when youre as young as braff is you havent really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder braffs experience looks to be from watching movies then repeating the same trite clichs in his own movie in garden state he plays andrew largeman a semisuccessful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years he appears to have no feeling about any of this he has no relationship with his father who blames him for causing his mothers paralysis in a freak accident as a sixyearold and has no particular despondency over losing his mother in fact he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his who works as a cemetery gravedigger it all smacks heavily of beautiful girls also about a guy who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang with his old friends with a little ordinary people thrown in on the side   its really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life given his father and his useless friends im surprised he didnt kill himself who are still living their lives as though theyre still in high school partying with dumb bimbos drinking and drugging etc none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the retarded quarterback natalie portmans character the most aware person in the movie does and say things like hey i remember you from junior year these guys are such losers for them watching television would be a cultural leap forward even one friend who made millions inventing a silent velcro has no real reason to live because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying and you dont need big money to party like a high school sophomore  braff it is revealed is heavily medicated which keeps from feeling and dealing with anything really like an adult would then he meets sam natalie portman a sortof lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10yearold in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size anyway they fall in love and braff learns to feel again the clichs come fast and furious braff has a long delayed hearttoheart talk with his cold distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game in one scene braff and portman are in the millionaire kids house playing touchyfeely is front of a giant fireplace and the bit is so routine so standard movieschtick i swear i halfexpected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire in another braff visits a doctor ron liebman to get his junk refilled and liebman tells him in easily the worst line in the movie the body can play tricks on you i once found my exbestfriends cufflinks in my wifes purse and i didnt have an erection for a year and a half obviously no licensed physician would ever say that but its dirtbag poetry a nod from braff to i guess his loser friends to let them know hes still thinking of them just as the 37 joke in clerks was kevin smiths nod to his dirtbag buddies   anyway braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope the story plays itself out predictably but if youre going to have a movie thats walltowall clichs at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it and braff does he has the right sort of vacancy of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonkedout andrew both real and poignant and natalie portman also of beautiful girls gives the movie a big lift with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion jean smart is surprisingly good as portmans mother and peter saarsgard though much better in shattered glass is notable as the gravedigger friend i would recommend garden state if you cant get enough storybook romance out of movies but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece theyre just clueless braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot write in a few fks and awesomes and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material it doesnt,0
tom cutler jackson is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleanerupper in his latest job he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isnt aware the crime hasnt been officially reported uh oh this cant be good   you hear about cleaners all the time but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up this one is different in that tom cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene hey someone has to do it you know the police wont the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up   this is almost a good thriller but a side plot involving toms daughter palmer makes this story somewhat awkward i guess they had to fill in some time oh they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot but it was still a reach and awkward see  this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy the music didnt help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey you know journey music get it ha  the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller   violence yes sex no nudity no language no,0
im sorry but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie but seriously i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally thats not a good thing the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable i just couldnt stop laughing at issacs voice it was just like a high pitched whiny girls british voice not to mention malicais over dramatic stick up his butt character  children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that commands them to sacrifice any 20 aged people when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help but of course they get caught in the kids trap and are getting sacrificed but malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following issacs orders  children of the corn couldve been something great but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of as much as i love stephen king im sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story or at least the actors destroyed it like i said for a good laugh watch it but im warning you its pretty pathetic  310,0
alexander nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lamentation and end in a triumphal cantata the story takes place in 1242 prince alexander nevsky nikolai cherkasov defeats the teutonic knights in a battle on the ice of lake peipus  the film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director sergei eisenstein at his most inventively pictorial and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds several films have scenes strongly influenced by the battle of lake peipus including doctor zhivago 1965 mulan 1998 and king arthur 2004 alexander nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential sovietmade historical film,1
if i didnt know any better i would have thought resurrection was made in the late 80searly 90s when crap sold as film in hollywood  i dont understand why people like christopher lambert he speaks like hes reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emote he was easily the movies weakest aspect the other actors were ok nothing horrible  its easy to see where the majority of the budget went the special effects the killings look pretty professional but hardly make up for the films dullness  i wouldnt go as far as to say resurrection is a carbon copy of se7en but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it centering on a religiousminded murderer on a modern crusade the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible passages and christian history to piece together the killers puzzle resurrection however is bereft of se7ens clever storytelling cinematography actingwell everything that makes it good instead resurrection lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise it  in conclusion resurrection was about as bad as i expected it to be i almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since i knew it would be bad going in butsue me,0
this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated i cant even count how many times ive seen dirty dancing this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love  there is something timeless about this movie i have loved other blockbuster love story movies like pretty woman and when harry met sally i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect the characters the chemistry between swaze and grey the movies direction the incredible dancing the warm summery atmosphere everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect it is an instant classic and ive never really seen a movie like it either before or since  i dont think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers dirty dancing has a nostalgic languid summery mood realistic characters a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us   this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it but i will mention i have no interest in seeing havanna nights this one they should have left alone,1
ok i would give this a 1 but im gonna give it a two because i laughed while watching this filmfirst of all i can make a much better movie than this onein a weekthe special effects made this film look like a joke one shouldnt make such films with horrible special effects because then people wont take it seriously the acting and direction was also horrible the screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasnt believable at all this has to be the worst indian film ever the songs were also bad the acting was bad and artificial need i say more dont watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is thats why i watched it i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get trust me i watched one of the worst films in history if not the worst film,0
if you like madonna or not this movie is hilarious i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release however over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun sure there are some bad lines  cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast she is cutefunny and is the only comedic role of her movie career madonna usually just plays herself in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film she really seems like somebody else for once of course the film is directed by james foley who filmed the dramatic and haunting at close range with sean penn  christopher walken and costars griffin dunn after hours who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material the story is nothing genius and dont expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun clean 80s romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs the 1 hit whos that girl the 2 hit causing a commotion and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads the look of lovetop 10 hit in the uk and cant stop a left over pop ditty from the true blue sessions the year before it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd,1
comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with mike myers austin powers and rowan atkinsons johnny english and more recently steve carell in the bigscreen version of the hit 60s show get smart  back in 1974 it was david jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attach case full of documents marked classified  the top secret life of edgar briggs was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as six dates with barker the doctor series and hark at barker  humphrey barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside michael palin terry jones and eric idle in the childrens comedy show do not adjust your set  ttsloeb cast jason as edgar briggs a wellmeaning but incompetent agent for the secret intelligence service whereas john steed wore a bowler hat briggs had a trilby whereas napoleon solo carried a radio pen briggs owned a pipe objects fell to bits in his hands he read confidential documents in bed while his wife  barbara angell  perused womans own  on one occasion it would be the other way round  when he tracked a pair of russian agents to a heliport he accidentally switched on the airports tannoy system and broadcast his plans to capture them when he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an sis man and his enemycontact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to brighton when he tried to organise the defection of a female russian scientist he took a short cut to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park yet like inspector clouseau he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleagues  as previously mentioned he was married his wife jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their highrise flat secret service this secret service that you never stop thinking about the secret service he shouted back think of the neighbours theyre not supposed to know im in the secret service  briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included coronation street villain mark eden  he was the psychotic alan bradley  as spencer michael stainton as buxton and doctor at seas elisabeth counsell as the lovely cathy strong they answered to the commander played by the late noel coleman the commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving briggs temporarily in charge of the sis  which naturally horrified everyone  this hilarious show was by richard laing and bernard mckenna who had written for the doctor series rather than spoof bond it was more of a sendup of the serious spy shows such as callan  though it had a bondstyle theme tune  furtive meetings in underground car parks codebreaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the pink panther films  briggs had all the ingredients to be a smashhit unfortunately it was not networked in the london area it was put out on sundays at 725 pm where it was trounced in the ratings by the bbcs soapy drama the brothers it was then moved to fridays at 7 pm because itv wanted to showcase its latest american import  the tv version of planet of the apes briggs never found an audience a similar fate befell jasons next major show 1976s lucky feller it was not until 1977 and a sharp intake of breath that he found his first successful solo vehicle  you can see the title sequence  along with two brief excerpts in german  for this series on youtube unfortunately that is all you can see jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on dvd a great shame for the moment however edgar briggs life will have to remain top secret  coda i have seen a number of episodes recently and im pleased to say it stands up incredibly well,1
in this silly symphony a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table the animation is fine where this short suffers is in a lack of humor perhaps ive just seen this dinner table adventure in one too many tom and jerry shorts even though this came first i just didnt find it that enjoyable,0
i watched gristle primarily for the presence of michael dorn as i enjoyed his worf portrayal on star trek tng but had never seen him out of his makeup dorn appears to have a nice presence and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career this movie however gave him little dramatic challenge except to prove that he can indeed use the f word  it appears that this movie was made by someone who fancied himself as a forwardthinking type with a social conscience yeah for 1965 today the themes are so belabored and sophomoric and cornball that even spike lees dreadful bamboozled looks good in comparison  this crimecaper flick has an intricate labrynth of double triple and quadruplecrosses but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it collapses upon itself within the first 30 minutes mostly after that point i simply watched out of momentum and a mild curiosity about how each scene would play out there is a great cast here you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from much better movies why are they all in this i suspect it was 1 the work and some money even if modest 2 perhaps the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around la you know perhaps they participated to support him as a fellow struggling movie guy on the third and fourth tiers of the hollywood scene dunno but the movie was halfbaked not really finished i gave it a 3 although my affection for the actors involved was undiminished from my admiration of their previous work lets hope everybody has moved on to more professional more carefully done and more thorough projects since,0
this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything,0
this has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns i have ever seen having a soft spot for the genre westerns are  or were since they are no longer made very often  morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions i purchased the dvd sight unseen because i had read enough about william s harts work much of which he wrote and directed to pique my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection  i must admit that i approached the actual viewing with some trepidation my previous experiences with silent cinema classics had left me feeling let down chaneys the phantom of the opera griffiths birth of a nation and fairbanks the mark of zorro were fine but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect they were either too long or too theatrical or both   the toll gate however emerged as a pleasant surprise  it is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner black deering played by hart leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang thinks the time has come for group to disband before its luck runs out he is however opposed by his chief lieutenant jordan who goads them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit everyone is killed except deering who is taken prisoner when his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending indian attack they allow him to escape free he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive soon he is pursued not only by the sheriffs posse but also by jordan now prospering from the reward money he has collected and his henchmen his flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son after some initial misgivings they take him into their hearts deering sees a chance for a new life but with the posse and jordan closing in realizes that this may not be possible   hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre as one of the pioneers of moviemaking he created many of the characters and situations that have become clich in westerns for more than ninety years what keeps his movies interesting however was his ability to go beyond the clich perhaps his imitators did not go far enough so that the material appears fresh and innovative even now three such instances in the toll gate illustrate this   1 in one scene his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill jordan and kills a bystander instead a subsequent closeup shows that he is clearly frustrated the frustration however comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target   2 in another as he flees from the posse his borrowed horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but before pulling the trigger gives his head a sad loving pat as if to say farewell to an old friend   3 and finally after he has strangled jordan and thrown his body over a cliff he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversarys pistol lying on the ground nearby he steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse it is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades   and i love the title the toll gate it is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one deerings payment comes in the form of sacrifice todays more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it  viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the dvds picture quality especially the badly deteriorated final reel i dont mind at all that a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost if you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept   william s hart was born in 1870 in new york but grew up in the minnesota and wisconsin where he learned to speak sioux and indian sign language he counted wyatt earp and bat masterson among his friends and collected remington paintings so his knowledge of the west was firsthand if his vision seems overly romanticized by todays standards it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed both the star and his films are overdue for reevaluation,1
i remember when this nbc miniseries aired when i was in high school after reading the novel i thought id check out some adaptations didnt expect much out of a tv miniseries but now i might have to check out some more this is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made writer simon moore who wrote the teleplay for the original traffic miniseries upon which the soderberg film was based came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly he frames gullivers adventures as flashbacks with the actual story beginning as gulliver first returns home everything having happened on one journey gulliver played by cheers ted danson is sort of crazyseeming when his wife mary steenburgen welcomes him back into his home unfortunately the house is now owned by the local doctor james fox who has designs on steenburgen gulliver seems merely disturbed at first but when he starts telling stories of tiny people thats all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum all four of gullivers travels are related in this version in the same order as the novel the only time this has been done on film i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks gullivers small son whom he has never met before reminds him of the lilliputians the doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the brogdingnagians and the doctors scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the laputans and the professors at the academy finally when he is put on trial he is reminded of the houyhnhnms and the yahoos the cast of this thing is amazing and includes peter otoole ned beatty alfre woodard john gielgud kristin scott thomas omar sharif and warwick davis the biggest flaw of the miniseries is that the acting is really uneven you have all these fine actors but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of la law but dont do well in a costume drama ted danson isnt especially great although he has a few sequences where he excels its probably better that he didnt attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent steenburgen is actually pretty good at it and is quite good overall another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly its not believable that gulliver spent eight years away from home as is claimed but in general it captures swifts tone and purpose very well while with its structure adding a new emotional level,1

despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer  by the way what has become of ms driver she had such a potential in the film industry  this to me was almost like an 1850s version of yentl without the musical fanfare with the death of her father driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family hiding her jewish identity  while i realize that this is a period peace it was awfully dull even for 1850 england and scotland  the lady of the house is most irritating with that singsong voice of hers i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment what kind of name is mary blackchurch i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian but does this name signify all the way  in the interim mary finds love with the young charges father wilkinson and his emotionally unbalanced son  in the end the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her familyphotography did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film  the early scenes of judaism practiced in 19th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more there is a definite underlying feeling of antisemitism by the wilkinson family but thats never allowed to come out,0
garden state was a mediocre film at best the film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer zach braff had rather than a cohesive story the disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it werent interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than quirky coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation zack walking past faucets that turn on as he passes crazy undercranked party scene shouting over a gorge the list goes on  the main character is flat disengaging and ultimately unlikable which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father selfishly ignoring his fathers problems including a recently deceased wife and droning on about his own what am i to do with my life problem  the film ends when andrew zach braff decides not to go back to la because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life sam natalie portman whom he has known for 2 days which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas sure you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities but if that is the case it could have been done better much better  this film does not know what it wants to be a drama a comedy a teenagewasteland film or a gamut of other things i say this not as a singlegenre oriented person but as a person who loves multigenre pieces such as those mastered by stanley kubrick the reason i feel it does not work for garden state is because rather than blending the genres together it jumps around one scene is one genre the next another and back again so on  i have heard many people tell me to cut zach braff some slack after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as director writer and lead actor impressive as it was a first film i should think that with as much money as he has he could do better there have been much better firsttime feature film directors michel gondry human nature david gordon green george washington maybe if he stuck to writing or directing or acting it would have been better zach braff is a talented performer maybe his second attempt wont be so tedious and disjointed,0

while in madrid i was able to see a screener copy of this film wow gallo is amazing in it very unusual performance he gives aside from gallos genius the film however is a dull a film i have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on laughable i am also a val kilmer fan so he was part of the reason i made such a grand effort to view the film the problem is val is really only in one scene having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast i have only seen stranded of the directors other films both films are far far below average but both contain very interesting vincent gallo performances if you are as much as a gallo fan as i then see this film regardless of how bad it is if you do not like gallo then there is zero left to love,0
i couldnt believe the eye candy from start to finish being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold there are so many rich full images that are put before me that each and every time that i see this movie i find something new that i had not seen before as with previous movies that i have seen such as blade and mystery men also by former music video directors the use of color to capture ones attention is utilized extremely well though the characters could have been developed better the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection even if you havent seen this on the big screen you wont be disappointed i know i wasnt,1
i nearly fell asleep during a screening of this of a boring story that seems to go on forever it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks after a heated affair the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways  the male prostitute then goes on a downward selfdestructive spiral trying to find his one true love repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love  in the meanwhile he hooks up with one ugly guy who i thought was also a male prostitute a gay basher and some guy who ends up having a threesecond sexual intercourse session with him in a back alley  it never ceases to amaze me how films still portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm   all of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them to which he discards their telephone numbers  there is a brief sideplot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle there is also another brief sideplot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window and there is also one more brief sideplot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person  none of these things really connect with each other only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is he seems to be living life like a ghost there was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the worlds saddest song on it  otherwise this movie just seems to go on forever filmed in black and white it may seem very dreamlike but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare  i found the ending to be confusing as i wasnt quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven that would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe but seeing as this is an independent film movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to use your imagination   for those of you who are seeking out nudity there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows in other words dont waste your time with this one  my rating  2 out of 10,0
a ditzy girl yes ditzy is about as complex as her character gets wont take no for an answer and does quirky things to get her husband back its too farfetched to be believable with such flimsy characters going through the motions but not farfetched enough to be fascinating in the way that say being john malkovich was so it ends up boring  sv,0
the basic premise of flatliners is fairly simple several medical students put themselves at the point of death in order to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact it sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories in todays world where hollywood has to mine foreign markets for the ideas to make a horror film flatliners is one of those rare gems that show hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enough  what separates flatliners from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not stoop to being condescending or arrogant flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained not moralised to in this kind of supernatural thriller the difference this restraint makes is really incredible whats even more incredible is that julia roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play julia roberts the theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience is in force here  the subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to intrude on their present time are done surprisingly well the moments when william baldwins character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing that william baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction i am not sure which  kiefer sutherland on the other hand really shines as the lead one really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why unfolds as kevin bacons character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is it becomes clearer what the film is about we can try to change the past as much as we like but its what we do with the present that matters most  another good aspect of flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive elaborate visual effects quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film flatliners did not expend its budget in places where it did not need to much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending simple trick photography or stock footage sometimes the simplest things are the best  if there is a problem with the film its that it feels about ten minutes too short the ending seems more perfunctory than conclusive as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film up so they can bring it out at a certain market time of course many films have been left with sore spots for this very reason so flatliners shouldnt really need to be any different the hundred and fifteen minutes we do get is highly satisfactory though not overly brilliant  i gave flatliners a seven out of ten it works well as a date flick or a kind of latenight popcorn film that aside it makes a good reminder that lowbudget horror shows werent always sad pieces of garbage,1
this is the absolutely worst show in the history of nickelodeon first of all no boarding school has a sushi bar flat screen tvs and gives every student a laptop this makes the show so unrealistic and boring the plots are pointless and incredibly boring the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life i really hate the fact that in the show zoey is the most popular girl in school and the prettiest and smartest and gets the best grades without doing any work she never has any real problems and every guy wants to date her she is so perfect there isnt anyone like that also i hate that everyone would do anything for her and everyone picks her for every team or club it is so annoying quinn is so obnoxious her experiments are pathetic pointless and fake chase is such a wimp he says he loves zoey but if he told her it would ruin their friendship how pathetic michael tries to be funny but he never accomplishes anything nichole is so perky and screams a lot she is never seen doing any work or studying but she is a straight a student lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks excuse my language need i say more i think no for your own good stay away from this show at all costs,0
this film is absolute cinematic genius it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie jack long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin this film is definitely 1010 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time,1
exreporter jacob asch eric roberts is hired by an acquaintance raymond j barry to find his exwife and son asch heads to palm springs and quickly locates the ex laine beverly dangelo with someone he believes to be the son a young johnny depp but things turn out to be a bit more complicated as asch discovers former white trash laine has definitely married up in the form of millionaire simon fleischer dan hedaya and her first son is nowhere to be seen  directorwriter matthew chapman is channeling body heat here and this mid80s neonoir is watchable enough thanks to an allstar cast and nice locations dangelo was still looking good around this time so she makes for a good femme fatale and isnt afraid to show some skin however the mystery isnt very compelling in the end costarring dennis lipscomb emily longstreth and henry gibson chapman made several thrillers in the 80s but his biggest career achievement was coauthoring the screenplay for the infamous color of night,1
in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep hammers dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of 1972 exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy van helsing an occult disciple named johnny alucard get it get it gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church among them van helsings great granddaughter jessica and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects dracula in a haze of smoke draculas only mission is to wreak havoc upon the entire van helsing lineage and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this this is probably the only 70s film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look likea 70s film considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact were in the 20th century now and thus he stuffs his film with insufferable hippiecharacters hideous 70s fashion trends and awful 70s music christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances regretfully show it the opening sequence a flashback and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary the greatest elements in this series of films have always been draculas dark castles and the exhilarating coach races and obviously this installment lacks all of that luckily for the fans hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better the vampire lovers twins of evil the legend of the seven golden vampires not recommended,0
i looked forward to seeing this movie because the trailer made it look so cool but the fact is that this movie is boring and totally muddled there is no plot and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games zoomed in shots that gives you no overview of the games i was constantly looking at the timer to see when the movie was over  theres only one good thing about this movie the sound the soundtrack is awesome dont expect anything from this movie,0
of all the adaptations of books by alistair maclean i feel that this qualifies as the worst but dont blame maclean it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title we have no suspense no sense of foreboding of mystery no chance to really empathize with the main characters we spend the entire duration or at least i did waiting for charlotte rampling to shed her clothing for charlotte this appears to take a remarkably long time still a glimpse of charlotte ramplings tits really cant save this disastrous film maclean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nitpickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books poor old alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out at least bear island  which also uses the maclean name but apparently none of his novel  was a little exciting the excitement here is in waiting for the final credits,0
well unlike most people i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together its a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesent quite turn out how you predicted i dont want to give away anything about the story so i wont but i suggest giving this one a chance if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold,1
i hate to admit it but i didnt find it to be one of hitchcocks best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchocks 1934 movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart  the man who knows too much  and his wife jo mckenna doris day are holidaying in morocco with their son hank christopher oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hank  i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcocks other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable  in comparison to the great directors other works i believe this isnt as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thrillermystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film,1

low budget horror about an evil force hard to believe in this day and age but way back when this stuff actually used to get theatrical release these days this sort of thing would either go directtovideo or straight to cable shouldnt be too hard to avoid this one whos ever heard of it,0
the most disposable movie in the history of cinemathis one is a strong contenderwhy wasting so much money for such a pointless useless work the only difference between the hitchcock classic and this poor imitation is colorwide screen and leilas walkmana movie whichs supposed to generate thrills and fear leaves me completely indifferent  no you re going to tell me it will urge the young generations to see the originalbalderdashthis psycho 1998 is a giant spoiler  they could have done something differentfor instance by casting an actor closer to bloch s bates an obese manthey content themselves with an obnoxious rehasha pox on itand long live alfred hitchcock,0

i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it but it has grown on me i love the costumes and poses the actors make the humor the cinematography the soundtrack the scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly every time i watch it there is something new that catches my eye aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it but not enough  also the lestat in this movie is different it is not the same character you can see that the character armand has been given lestatlike qualities because im assuming anne wanted it in but there is no reason to trash this movie just because its not like books its a fascinating by itself,1
saw this last night at the 7th annual nyc home film festival  a rather tumultuous venue that quieted down for this sweet and touching twowoman film  the relationship between the two  one older and blind the other a twenty something who helps her with her mail  is established deftly and its depth is readily apparent  there are no car chases explosions or mindboggling special effects  just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped  see if it you can,1
truly awful nonsensical garbage this movie does everything wrong except make the running time under an hour the gore fx defy gravity  logic there are no scares the acting is abysmal with everyone appearing to be reading their lines theres a surprise ending thats just silly where we find out that things we saw happen didnt even happen boy do i hate cop out endings they pad this thing out with long drawnout shots of people doing nothing interestinglike putting on makeup or talking for what seems like forever they have to pad out a movie thats under an hour long ridiculous the story itself is pretty freakin thin i mean its just a variation of the movie april fools day if i remember that movie correctly and that film wasnt all that great either the only good thing i can say is it seems to have been shot well too bad nothing happens thats very exciting,0
this movie has no plot it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself but what happens after everyone finds out who hes living with they have a big pot party at grandmas house the climax of the movie didnt even relate to the rest of it that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movies end i can see how it could have related to the supposed story  that grandmas vg skills redeem him  but that just wasnt there   however the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes   her pussy smells like the great depression he just sucked his first tittyyeah for 13 hours its for youi think its the devil,0

i bought jacko a number of months ago at a blockbuster video sale and at the time i wasnt expecting anything outstanding from it upon watching it i realized i not only got less than i could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well it seems strange i know and it is but its perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is jacko  the movie follows a young boy named shawn kelly somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding pumpkin man this pumpkin man was killed by shawns greatgrandfatherunclecousinetc and now that the villain has been resurrected shawns death is apparently crucial to his hellbred mission of vengeance anyway much horror ensues as jacko hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling shawn to the finish  im not so much here to discuss the plot as i am to determine who may find any worth in this movie i can honestly tell you that jacko is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time the acting is deadpan except when it should be the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded 150 some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this antithriller and theyre all the more humorous when you realize director steve latshaw actually seems serious in his moviemaking  and yet i heartily enjoyed the film i can call it a terrible horror movie yes but i can also say i had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing many people including some of my friends will find this movie intolerable and needlessly timeconsuming and thats understandable if youre like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously youll find jacko an instant classic which is also understandable  thats why its so hard to rate this movie if i were rating jackos quality as a film i wouldnt give it anything in fact the studio would owe me stars yet if i were rating its on the basis of pure enjoyment id give it an 8 or a 9 ill give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle i recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion,0
theres a spartan unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us how were meant to be feeling in blue everything was overtly sad sure powerful as hell but still in white it was delightful whimsy but there are no such emotional clues or cues for that matter in this one its as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzledazzle embelishment i think thats what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three but finally the most transcendent and redemptive never has remorseless unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful,1
i wasnt expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace i felt like many of the other things were not for example  how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her  the very strong and well acted love scenes  the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more  their strong differences of what it means to be vampire created by their prior life experiences  the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie  ive heard and read several things about tricks used in other films of course however i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well i dont need a director to use new tricks i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film   i recommend it,1
in cold mountain north colorado near to the period of the american civil war the reverend monroe donald sutherland arrives in the small town with his daughter the shy ada monroe nicole kidman due to health reasons ada meets the also shy inman jude law and they fall in love with each other with the beginning of the war inman becomes a soldier and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see ada in cold mountain again meanwhile ada meets ruby thewes rene zellweger a survivor of the war who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend the story alternates present and past situations disclosing a beautiful romance i liked this film a lot having names such as philip seymour hoffman natalie portman and giovanni ribisi in the supporting cast a magnificent direction of anthony minghella and seven indications to the oscar this movie does not disappoint my remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the dvd at least one of them which show what happens with sara her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm should not be deleted as it was my vote is nine  title brazil cold mountain,1
clint howard brother of more talented ron stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people striving to be a movie thats of the so bad that its good variety this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as so bad that itswellbad wheter its the constant shoe ad cinema the pillow stuffed fat kid or the sleep inducing horror that soured me on the film i dont know all i know is i loathed the film and this from a guy who has a soft spot for bhorror films paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this his only mainstream film a wise choice indeed as horrible acting nonsense storyline and ludicrous dialog are much much more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing funnily enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity another reason to steer clear   my grade d,0
others main criticism of this filmnamely that macy suddenly looks jewish upon donning his glassesis misplaced the glasses are just the little bit of change needed to convince others hes a jew the scene in which he says to his boss paraphrasing but you know what my background is along with another discussion with his mother suggests that hes had to fight this same assumption in the past the glasses now make him look just jewish enough to confirm his neighbors and coworkers existing suspicions then there is his new wifes large nose and taste for loud clothes which of course means shes jewish the whole point of the film is how those little stereotypical nothings become the entire basis for judging others   if he has a lisp he must be gay if he has long hair he smokes dope if hes hispanic hes got a knifeand if he has round black glasses and hes slight of build he must be jewish those statements all sound equally implausible to me if the conclusion people were jumping to in focus was reasonable the whole point of the story would be lost,1
director don siegel really impressed me with this film it is starkly shot graphic without being visually graphic wellacted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer i didnt know what to expect sitting down to watch this a civil war movie or some kind of 70s softcore peddling with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women  a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized as one reviewer previously noted none  none  of the characters are likable by the films end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic eastwood plays cpl mcburney a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdinyoull recognize that voice as soon as you hear it a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war  particularly in the south soon page teacher elizabeth hartman lovely young seductress carol and even ferdinamyhave emotionalsexual ties to eastwood  each having their own needs and secrets and problems eastwood is not a nice man he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest the beguiled for me is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front this might beexcept for invasion of the body snatchers siegels best film it certainly is one of eastwoods best real performances page is always so very good and hartman fe5rdin et al excellent the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic some of the sexuallaced scenes disturbing and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film,1
shame on you if you give this film a low rating how can you not like a film that has doug mcclure peter cushing silly rubber monsters fights and for the guys that woman that was the baddies henchwoman in the spy who loved me and one of the seventies sinbad films not wearing very much of whom my mother said she wasnt picked for the colour of her eyes lava silly wigs and a daft victorian drilling machine very much like the one used in the old thunderbirds series whoever watched this film and slagged it off was watching it for the wrong reasons it may be crap but is definitely good crap they dont make em like they used to sigh,1
i have no respect for imdb ratings anymore i think a bunch of mormons flooded the website and voted for this this is not an artistic movie it is mormon propaganda nothing wrong with that but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading if you are a bible thumping christian or a mormon watch this movie youll love it and think it is truly amazing for anyone else dont bother the story is so contrived random stuff happens that really doesnt follow in a coherent way this guy tries to commit suicide cause he sleeps with his neighbor are you kidding what a pussy anyways this is an awful movie,0
the 80s were the best of times and worst of times for james karin he starred in one of the best cult horrorcomedies with return of the living dead and a year later he acts in this piece of this bad movie a sequel to hardbodies but not really has a group of fairly unlikeable characters attempting to make a movie in greece through design or sheer laziness the line between the film and the film within a film is not only blurred but throughly nonexistent from scene to scene which would be confusing if i were just interested in anything happening in the movie in the first place unfunny would be too generous a term  eye candy nana fabiana udenio and many numerous extras get topless brenda bakke shows some ta  my grade f  dvd extras just trailers for hardbodies american high school strike virgin territory comes in a doublefeature dvd with the first film for the masochistic,0
there could be some spoilers ahead but i doubt it i have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder its horrible completely unwatchable i hung in there for 45 minutes about half the running time and just couldnt stand it anymore i was an elijah wood fan in the 90s see the war and i learned to enjoy mandy moores shifts from bubbly to serious this year see chasing liberty which is surprisingly entertaining ive seen bits of run lola run so with three leads i liked this should have been fine it wasnt nobody turned in a good performance woods jones was flat for an aspiring writer he had next to no imagination his violent fantasies looked like they were ripped off from a christmas story and his lustful ones werehuh a cross between boring and alarming potente is absolutely unlikable from the first second and id only know that she was supposed to be the girl by reading the box speaking of the synopsiswhoever they employed for that job made the film sound funny quirky romantic and quite enjoyable whoever that person was he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script by the halfway point i didnt care about any of the characters anymore moores lisa is an aspiring actress whos bubbly and a little conniving for no apparent reason at all but her ludicrous period play which is supposed to be funny in presentation is on a par with the rest of the script there is supposedly a happy romantic comedy ending to this turkeygiven the character material they had to work with i just cant envision it save your money warn your friends dont watch this movie,0
this movie moved much too slowly for my tastethe concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentallyretarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen onscreenhoweverthe execution of the concept was flawedeach character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearancethen one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the waythat iseach character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the moviewhich i found to be a form of emotional and social retardationi suppose this has artistic meritgiven the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way aboveaverage intelligence friends and familythe actinghoweverwas welldone without exceptioni agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautifulin summaryi think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematographybut fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described,0
i watched sleeper cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified this mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly it created depth and substance to almost every character oded fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene hes inand even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell he still has hypnotic appeal michael ealy held his own well though in some scenes i wondered why he wasnt shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face  the pros of the series are the two leads fehr and ealy the well written charactersall of which were believable and tragic and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story having been married to a muslim myself the atmosphere created was quite realistic the cons for me personally were that the female ta was overkillmost seemed gratuitous as well as some of the sex scenes despite that it is a raw gripping series that will make you think somebody give fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it hes got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him,1
the problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile a 6 hours movie into 2 hours the result is clear it seems too forced unclear and too simple minded  the only plus side is the beginning it explains well why and how hercules was born the rest of the movie wasjust mumbo jumbo that is put together it has a potential to be a great movie like lotr if only it is not forced into 2 hours  the acting is not very convincing either ok not all is bad but most of them are special effects are stupid and look like it is made ten years earlier although the 1st monster is pretty good overall i give it 4 out of ten for the reasons i described above,0
this is one dreary inert selfimportant bore when the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging you know the venture is botched philip seymour hoffman plays truman capote as a narcissistic ticridden selfindulgent cartoonvoiced insectlike caricature why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information the script focuses on capotes writing of in cold blood and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four the acclaimed writer of to kill a mockingbird harper lee catherine keener accompanies capote in his initial inquires into the crime and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic unfortunately lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of capote bemoaning his pained existence watching him is like watching dr smith from lost in space complain about his delicate back to anybody who will listen for two hours the difference however is that smith was fun to watch while capote is not the films precious selfimportance kills it as does director bennett millers reluctance to add any kind of shading like the morose piano score the film is a one note wonder providing no contrast no emotional coloring and no intimate drama if capote really was this irritating why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it though the supporting roles are well performed chris cooper is his usual stalwart self they serve such little dramatic purpose because ultimately its all about capote director bennett and screenwriter dan futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of capotes legend their product is stillborn oscar baitand is more evidence that one great genre pic has more truth in it than a dozen piles of ohsosincere crap like this,0
greetings moviegoers as i watch octopus ii i contemplate the inherent lameness of the octopuscrocdino horror genre many moviegoers may blame the poor acting nonsensical screenplay or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the ocd movie to flounder these reasons may indeed be floundering factors but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an ocd movie that is at the heart of the lameness  you see the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic lifesize ocd and the cgi technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters even with clever cinematography you can only film the semidark depths of the seasemidark forestsemidark cavesemidark corridor so many times before the scifi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely the ocd subgenre that is  what can be done you ask i wouldnt suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness but another avenue needs to be explored we cant really go back to the days of the fadetoblack cue that someone has been killed or can we if we cant reach the goal of realism we have to compensate in other ways such as plot twists innuendo and photoingenuity  it will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness so common to the ocd subgenre will be cured,0
with what they had john and carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could i really liked portia de rossi as carolyn but jacqueline bissets voice grated on my nerves she should have used her regular voice i would have preferred that the whole movie focus on john and carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about john,1
it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting it happens quite often not only is dark harbor uninteresting but it is very poorly done scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble  some movies build tension by building the story dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it i was hoping that like other movies the suspense would finally explode it never does also the characters have no continuity from scene to scene they may act one way in one scene but then act a completely different way in another scene at first you think that they are merely out of character but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all they are just props for the final twist the final ten minutes try to be shocking instead its rather lame and uninteresting the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long  this isnt one of those lowbudget gems its more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home,0
i went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site i really dont have time to write reviews but i felt this was my duty as a scifi horror buff this is only the second review i have written the other was for dracula 3000 now to the point this movie sucked plain and simple i kept wondering if i was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those lovely comments i have seen movies with bad effects bad acting bad sound you name it and ive seen it but this really sucked i dont care how much it costs or didnt cost to make movies like this and dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder by the way did i mention that this movie sucked i mean really sucked the plot was non exist and the acting was weak it seems like the writer saw pitch black and got upset because he didnt think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version but instead the suck factor took over and possessed him dont watch this youll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals,0
a group of adventurers travel to the dark continent to try and locate a lost heiress named diana who disappeared years before in a plane crash and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess  once again my search for sleazy european cannibal movies has taken me deep into jess franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with subpar scriptwriting crawling with crap camerawork and abundant with awful acting franco regular lina romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing elderly woman it is here in this hellish place that i finally stumbled upon diamonds of kilimanjaro an abysmal junglebased exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching it  tawdry and unrelentingly dull even by francos standards this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of edgar rice burroughs tarzan albeit with a feminine twist the film appears to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in africa and the death scenes are virtually bloodless franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter but despite initial appearances this isnt a cannibal movie and it isnt that gory  where the director does succeed however is in his casting of sexy young katja bienert as jungle jailbait diana running and leaping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy loincloth her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time this nubile beauty makes quite an impression franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of mari carmen nieto as treacherous traveller lita who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions and aline mess as topless warrior woman noba thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of 110 from me although im sure hell be receiving plenty more in the futurei have loads of his films yet to see,0
im a big fan of patricia hodge and mariam margolyes so i watched this show when it came on ae some years ago the show was strange to say the least but i gave it a chance because i liked these actresses this has got to be one of the worst shows ive ever seen i wouldnt watch it again and certainly wouldnt waste money on buying the video the storyline of this tv version is ludicrous and just plain stupid the kicker pun intended comes when ruth has surgery done on her leg bones that kind of nonsense belongs in james bond and scifi movies if this version is true to the book then i wont be checking the book out from my local library the american version came out some years after id seen this original to my surprise the americans got it right this time as their version with meryl streep and roseanne is played for laughs and is rather funny when played for laughs the storyline works,0
okay ill say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people dont get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and youll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a sidesplitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and its all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for me  for example anne tiler to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darling  if that chunk of dialogue doesnt make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully youll see whats so damn funny about jack frost 2,1
on a flight back from london i watched shes the man apparently air canada has a crap movie policy perhaps thats not the best way to start a review of this movie amanda bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town even if you check your mind at the door on a 6 hour flight you have to the story is implausible and ridiculous there are some moments of humor mostly from comedian david cross as the principle but the intricate love polygon doesnt really inspire emotion although is is cleverly mixed with the caveat of mindless plausibility the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest i guess if i was a 12yearold girl i might have really enjoyed this one,0
another bmovie for teenagers based mainly on cgieffects industrial soundtrack and some medieval imagery its a pitty that the legend for beowulf is used in such uninspired manner i am a fan of christopher lambert but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too rent it if you are teenager only,0

it is said that there are some people out there who actually admire monograms movies well  and why not monogram studios lived on a kind of cost plus basis cost plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while sure theyre cheap but lets face it theyre coarse fast philistine vulgar but exhilarating they have no pretensions at all theyre designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill so what if john wayne gallops through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles this isnt art its entertainment  take this movie flight to mars at the beginning when were first meeting the characters a man might introduce his female companion abruptly avoiding any tedious subtlety professor this is my fiance and assistant who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman she loves me but is growing impatient with me because im always wrapped up in my scientific work perhaps you could steal her from me marry her give her the babies and the picketfenced home she yearns for if necessary i will die on this journey to see her dreams realized also she likes it a little rough it saves a lot of writing and shooting time doesnt it thats what people mean when they say a narrative is fast this one was shot in five days why should we have to hint about these things i mean what the hell is this a cheap sci fi movie or henry james actually this is a particularly wellfunded example of a monogram movie its in color for one thing cinecolor to be exact you can tell its not any other color youd recognize and look at the cast the female lead is dismissible as is usual with monogram but the male leads are definitely up there on the b list cameron mitchell as the reporter yet to hit his stride as a male lead which come to think of it he never really did and arthur franz as the pipesmoking head scientist the pride of perth amboy new jersey and  for science fiction fans  how about this pair of aces both morris ankrum and john litel theres not really much point in describing the plot in detail the five crew members crash land on mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts and they picked up english from listening to our broadcasts american broadcasts that is judging from their speech theyre led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship build many imitations of it and colonize earth they do not succeed  the special effects arent very special the men walk around a couple of spare sets wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them their names consist exclusively of english phonemes  alzar terris ikron the lissome martian who falls for arthur franz is named alita with an indoeuropean diminutive appendage and she already knows what kissing is  overall i found it as snappy as it was intended to be but dull too the story is that of any buck rogers 1930s serial once the earthlings and the martians meet and its established that they have a common language and that the martians have a sinister agenda thats it in two hours even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of nazi spies in world war ii the plot is done by the numbers the dialog has no sparkle the acting is pedestrian  however dedicated aficionados of monogram productions should enjoy it after all jeanluc goddard the contrarian french egghead dedicated a bout de souffl to monogram so they cant have been all that bad,0
this isnt a very good movie but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed lloyd kaufman  the brains behind troma  isnt concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film his chief concern is making something bizarre and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema  in this film we have the titled character luther  whose favorite pastime isnt baseball but biting the heads off of chickens  receiving his release from lockup the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesnt speak  he merely clucks like a chicken  and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal of course once luther is set free he goes about causing mayhem first at a grocery store and later at a farm house  violence  lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse  nudity  stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture as the former lois lane i cant recall which superman edition she was from gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend  a guy who just doesnt have any chemistry with ms haiduk the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy she is quite something  story  forgettaboutit whitey styles screenplay may just be the worst ever written the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window his dialogue is something that a preschooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd its as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations  acting  the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriends lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best,0
this production of hamlet prince of denmark is by far the best that i have seen although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations it does have the most important element sir derek jacobi as hamlet  jacobis portrayal of the disturbed prince is multilayered and riveting his displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map but without seeming forced or overthetop in fact some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them with stillness soft speech and thoughtful expression as to whether or not he interprets hamlet as mad or sanewell you should decide for yourselves i changed my mind more than once at one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness but suspects that he is actually mad after alla revelation to himself captured beautifully having performed the part of hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history jacobis affinity for the role then comes as little surprise  as for the production itself it is presented as a kind of filmedcopy of the stage play with little special effects or fancy camera work minimal sets and no musical accompaniment to speak of this production relies on the acting prowess of the cast and the words of shakespeare to evoke the emotion and interest of its audience and it works the other players are topnotch as well particularly patrick stewarts claudius and claire blooms gertrude together the cast present a seamless ensemble  the last but far from least element that makes this production stand out is the play itself here it is presented in its entirety a rarity on film but oddly enough i never noticed the time i was too busy getting caught up in the story i suspect that you will too,1
ukborn australian helmer alex frayne calls for attention with his strange necessitating a meticulous read visually stunning modern love 2006 following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology distributed by accent filmaustralia  john mark constable his wife emily victoria hill and their son edward william traeger arrive in a small southern town to take care of his deceased uncles don barker property while emily and edward check into a local hotel john begins to question the locals about uncle toms death  some say that he committed suicide some are unwilling to talk puzzled john comes up with a theory of his own  uncle tom is alive and well hiding in the nearby bushes  if not for the occasional lines of dialog used to ease its heavy atmospheric tone modern love could have been easily mistaken for a sokurov film shot with a 16mm camera its washedout color scheme is strangely evocative of the russian directors reflective forays into human agony perhaps it isnt a coincidence that it was at the moscow international film festival where modern love had its premiere  looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture  while sokurovs films tend to remain painfully intimate to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the directors preferred yellow modern love very much feeds off the australian countryside johns gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of fraynes vision  in sokurovs the second circle a young man returns to the russian countryside to bury his deceased father in the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust he gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of his father in a coffin then he bids goodbye and buries it the rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the soviet system the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with  in modern love somewhat ironically love is nowhere to be seen on the contrary it is pain loneliness and dissatisfaction with modernity that suddenly invade johns life unlike the second circle however here the main protagonist has the opportunity to reembrace his modern life his wife and son await him yet he walks away slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past  i doubt frayne intended for modern love to be so strikingly similar to what sokurov did in the second circle yet the pacing and in particular the puzzling framing are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience  a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection  mark constable delivers a topnotch performance as john adding even greater depth to his highly challenging character his facial expressions are outstanding both victoria hill and william traeger match perfectly with their performances pics tense visual style,1
it is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the us that it approaches hysteria  heavens gate is a bad movie it is fundamentally awful endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose muddy dialogue murky narative no sense of any theme aside from excess  the high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception  for some perspective watch lawrence of arabia before watching heavens gate you will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is the issues it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma  i have no problem with films that are critical of the us per se but when a terrible film gets such undeserved praise purely because of that element thats worth challenging  the film is worth seeing for two reasons curiosity and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakers  i saw this at home for free imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it for 4 meandering hours,0
has this ever happened to you i go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the film noir section i spy a copy of a new arrival of a film i have never seen called naked alibi its from one of those mail order video companies that offers mostly dupey looking copies of hard to find titles the description on the box sounds good the film has players i like sterling hayden gloria grahame and gene barry so i take it home and watch it about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts about half way through this film i started to dislike it by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it the film opens with cops questioning al willis on suspicion of robbery other than being drunk the police have nothing on him when he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home the cops beat him up detective conroy arrives lets the cops finish the beating and then announces willis is in the clear willis swears he will get revenge later one of the police officers is shot dead with no evidence other that willis is sore about the beating conroy make willis his sole suspect despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects conroy arrests him but for lack evidence willis is released the next day two more cops are killed by a bomb this time conroy goes to the bakery that willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him conroy doesnt know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of conroy trying strangle willis and conroy is fired but conroy continues his pursuit and willis flees to mexico where willis has a mistress conroy manages to convince his mistress who willis treats rather rough to help him prove willis is a killer what this film lacks is a convincing script the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it other than the fact that willis likes to tip a glass now and than there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife he treats his wife his kid and employees well early in the film one gets the impression that its conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon he seems to casually approve of police brutality conroy for no reason is convinced from the very start willis has criminal past he seems to operate on the motto of the old communist bulgarian secret police everyone is guilty of something we just have not found out about it yet later conroy shows kindness to als mistress and young son now we are supposed to like him sorry the early impression i got of conroy stuck with me too long and he is also a dumb cop only after he is fired and goes to mexico does he run a background check on willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in maryland why didnt he think of this before because this film hadnt used up enough running time the cast is good gene barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of al willis is im big fan of 40s and 50s crime thrillers but not only did i not think this film was good it left a bad taste in my mouth something many modern films do but older films rarely do,0
ive read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book i dont think any of them have actually read it edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view ive never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgars vision maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story so if youve never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals maybe a good cry see the movie i hope john carter of mars gets more respect than tarzan has we miss ya edgar,0
well my dad drove lee evans back and forth the hotels so i got to see some being made its a brilliant film bob pugh walked past a shed with a lawnmower and he accidentally let go and it went into a fence and he fell over  lee evans was also funny as he seen me and said are you cold i said yes and he said well whack your hands in your pockets i think it was really funny and it will be a wellknown comedy as like every other lee evans film they were really great people they seemed to be quite polite and funny i would like to meet them again one day brenda blethyn walked out of her caravan with blood down her and twigs in her messy hair and i got really scared as i didnt notice her until she was right behind me,1
it is difficult today and in the us to understand this movie we have nothing really to compare it with here is an attempt at comparison it is as if during the last years of saddams rule a filmmaker in iraq were somehow able to make a film which for the first time ever showed life as it really was lived in that country the life of ordinary young girl with all the terror and the repression full blown then the film was exhibited freely in iraq if you could imagine that unlikely event then you might have an idea of what went on with this film in the last few years of the soviet union prior to this film soviet cinema was highly censored soviet movies would only show an ideal life in the workers paradise then suddenly this the alcoholism the random sex the ugly wasteland that was the soviet city the choking pollution the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves the utter hopelessness  it is all there people were stunned soviet women would often weep during the showings many would say that this is the story of their lives it was a cultural earthquake the like of which filmmakers only dream of accomplishing it undoubtedly hastened the breakup of the soviet union   reading the reviews here i can see that few understand this film one says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex to the soviet viewers at the time the sex was a minor event compared to fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in soviet cinema   others compare it to current films such as as good as it gets might as well compare homers illiad to the latest john grissam novel they simply do not compare this is not just a film this is was a social document and a transforming social force it needs to be viewed that way or you will not understand the film   other reviewers see it as a film about a dysfunctional russian family one even says that it is difficult to feel sorry for vera because she keeps coming back to her family the point is that vera and her family are symbols for all of soviet life there was nowhere else to go because the family down the block and in the next town were the same this was life in the soviet union for most people   this is a film that can be viewed on many levels as a drama it traces the landscape of despair as a social document it shows the living conditions of the time as a political document it shows the attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the breakup of the soviet union and as a moral document it shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the cruelties that victims will practice on each other   little vera clearly shows the human toll that socialism eventually takes on its victims despite any good intentions that system may have in doing so it helped end the soviet regime thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history this film achieves what only a few films have ever accomplished it is not only an stunning representation of history but it also become a force in that shaped history,1
hey its great not to have to wait for the next startrek convention to see hicktrek its a cheesy film by a bunch of treckies with no budget but a good way to spend an hour they got most of the special effects right the dialog is classic trek and it just feels right for a trekknockoff,1
harrowing series about life in ozan experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate prisoners theres gay sex rape torture mutilation killings humiliation tons of male nudityall in your face and going full force  it also is easily one of the best written dramas ever put on tv and almost all the actors are just great since this was on cable there were no restrictions on what they could say or show theres plenty of racist comments flying in here but its for all races in fact the white characters come off pretty badly especially the aryans and the black characters come off better the peaceloving muslims the hispanics dont have a strong role and there are no asian prisoners at all all the prisoners seem to be backstabbers and willing to kill anyone at a moments noticebut you still find yourself sympathizing with some of them even the guards counselors and doctors at the prison have serious issues  i heartily recommend this but rent itdont buy it i have the whole collection and to be totally honest i dont think i ever want to see it again its incredible tv but so grim dark and depressing guess i gotta sell it all online  i give it a 10,1
just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard geres brief appearance as a shellshocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan janmicheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the allamerican boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peaceloving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if youre looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if youre looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you,1
kannathil muthamittal is for sure a great movie i have to give it to mani ratnam for a great directing job and ar rahman for great songs the camera work is just excellent and is similar to black hawk down and saving private ryan i will be shocked if this movie does not win an oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work,1
terry benedict andy garcia catches up with danny ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him in oceans 11 plus interest he holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the worlds greatest thief the night fox the team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the night fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever put simply this film is a complete mess the masses may argue that it is cool and that clooney and pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to hello magazine and think that david beckham has the potential to be a great actor the story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent hello magazine readers any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is whilst oceans 11 wasnt a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns this movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up it is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this isnt really working out lets just have a laugh indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but i was not i will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination the addition of catherine zeta jones is largely annoying the scenes where julia roberts impersonates herself with bruce willis undertaking a cameo role whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested the movie is so full of plot holes that it as if arnie has emptied an uzi 9mm into the film studio credit can only be given to some scenes where the night fox uses caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie the final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor this accurately sums up the movie stick with the original,0
i first saw this as a kid the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born and fairly recently bought this on dvd in between i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 the pie fight itself and 2 how racist some of these parts were farina as a nubian slave doing voodoo for example i think roach and mcgowan would have been beaten to death if theyd tried to do that now  notice how the pie fights in the three stooges halfwits holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this oneand this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel  hardys the battle of the century for these filmsremember at that time they all stole from the best each other   one more note laurel  hardy buffs that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn who also appeared in tbotcthe flapper getting into her car and getting it in the rear end it always escapes me why she was never credited,1

i am a big md fan but i call it like i see it this film limped along the plot was preposterous gaining access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to the the local grocery store come on tone loc has the emotion of a wooden plank loosen up the editing is choppy the actors and i use the term loosely sound as if they are reading their lines on valium  this movie could have been better dudikoff has potential but he chooses scripts that just screamstinker  if you want to watch a good dudikoff movie may i suggest crash dive or avenging force if you have never seen one of his films this is not the one to introduce you to his work you will walk away with a bad taste in your mouth and think all of his projects are this bad,0
rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award the acting script continuity et cetera are all just about perfect and the story is well worth the viewers 82 minutes although the picture softpetals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual  such disguises never work perhaps werent intended to  i could nitpick about a few details but just for fun there was no allnight movie house in washington dc in 1947  and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldnt talk through the show there werent any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde none if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news not the timeshearald evening star and certainly not the knownothing washington post but these little things take nothing away from this classic  the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score except during the credits ive only seen this done in a few films  on the negative side since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was ready for in 1947 blah blah blah as if this fool has any business judging his betters id say the exgis in 1947  the greatest generation  were much smarter and had better values  than some commentator film historian or other wisemouth in 1995 put a sock in it,1
i absolutely loved this movie its my number one favorite although there were a few flaws what movie doesnt have flaws this movie was very well written directed and produced the characters in this movie are very real and believable they made all of the characters fit into a specific role i think that the most apparent thing about here on earth was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie its not one of those movies where you just cant seem to relate to anything because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time here on earth will make you laugh cry and sometimes angry i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion,1
i seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere which luckily happens from time to time in european cable television i experience the same thing im moved entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one  it all deals with leo kevin mckidd and his group of friends living in urban london leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious new age mens group and falls for straight guy brendon played by dashing james purefoy who turns out not so straight after all thrown in as side characters are the equally great tom hollander and hugo weaving whose side story alone is worth watching the movie simon callow as the leader of the mens group turning in a great as ever performance but its really hard to pick some folks out here because every character the female ones like jennifer ehles julie grahams and harriet walters as well are exquisitely acted maybe even kevin mckidd looks a little pale compared to his coactors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character  the idea behind this movie is a simple one there is never only black and white classifications are difficult and may not always stand the test of time  leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and brendons long time girlfriend brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all darren and jeremy hollander and weaving are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie like angie leos female roommate get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie the comedy bitsespecially tom hollander whos just hilarious are funny and on point and the emotions are believable as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary  what i like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion whether youre gay straight bisexual or simply not sure this movie leaves you feeling that its just okay not to be sure and that not being sure might be something worth living out as well sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it apart from all the gaystraight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies i can only wholeheartedly agree with the subtext of the movie that what you feel certain of one day when you think you identify as gay straight whatever can look very different on another i have never seen what to call it bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner   this movie dares going where few movies go gay or straight movies by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on that it goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after wellknown classifications and i think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this one   and for all others who dont care about that heck its just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands give it a try  loved it,1
i was waiting to welcome arnold schwarzenegers return to action after the dismal movies hed made after eraser end of days however can be added to the dismal films hes had the misfortune of appearing in  end of days starts well with a gripping action sequence yet quickly becomes a bore taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium read doomsday   performances are stale special effects soso and gore plentiful considering myself a diehard schwarzenegger fan i couldnt believe i didnt like this film but with such an awful lame script what could arnie have done besides passed on this turkey  3 out of 10,0
great just great the west coast got dirty harry callahan the east coast got sharky burt reynolds plays sharky in sharkys machine and i enjoyed every minute of it playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta ga is just what everyone wants instead of suspension hes sent to vice squad like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies the captain is always going to be the jerk when i was a kid i was curious what that movie meant sharkys machine well i knew who played sharky i wonder what his machine was it was his group of fellow cops after uncovering the murder he goes all out to find the perp when it turns out to be a big time mob boss sharky doesnt play around when he gets the other prostitute into safety sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window that was the bomb randy crawfords street life really put the movie in the right mood and the movie itself is really a great hit to me always rating 4 out of 5 stars,1
yes the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child it was called screamers on this particular cover with the tagline men turned inside out it even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a persons flesh to burn off maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage yes all these thoughts ran through my mind one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore this movie is really more like the island of dr moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes these films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes yes i know i have strange tastes but i can not help it i like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither,0
i finally saw this on video after years of hearing about it it is by no means a perfect movie but it is oddly hypnotic  one of those rare special films that creates its own world   spoilers first the bad stuff the scenes in burkewaites class are excruciating even if the subject is social studies this guy is way over the top his speeches are so overwrought they are laughable and no teachers i ever had would grill their students like that and tell the ones who protest to shut up these scenes are brief but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story next how the heck does layne just walk out of the police station near the end also what happened to samsons car after the first scene of him riding into town he spends the rest of the film being chaffeured around by layne or feck end spoilers   ahhh feckthis guy is great dennis hopper effortlessly steals the movie checks in the mail i love company youre my friend  every line is a classic he gives feck an internal logic that makes the story work incredibly he actually makes the audience feel empathy for this guy especially when samson talks about his samsons future    by contrast crispin glover is hard to take sometimes yet the scenes of him driving around in the beetle are perfect  kids with cars in high school always have something to do and buds to do it with matts lowkey attitude makes a good foil for layne  their friendship is believable glovers mannerisms are a little much but he is consistent throughout he drives the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else does  just try to imagine this flick if layne were as much of a zombie as matt or samson  snoozefest   spoilers what makes rivers edge unsettling is the fact that samson is not really evil in the usual sense he is kind of a boring guy who got sick of being taken for granted  in other words he is like thousands of other boring guys after he kills jamie he starts to unravel which creates some suspense as we wait to see when he will snap again end spoilers  part of this movies appeal is the way the action stays centered around the teens and their point of view the parents are comic relief  clarissas mom tonys dad  or overwhelmed  matts mom this underlines how the kids hang together for the attention no one else gives them it keeps the story focused on the relationships within the clique and emphasizes that the only adult they can relate to is feck rivers edge is a textbook on alienation it conveys how awkward mysterious and disconcerting adolescence is like no other film,1
this was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced there were so many ugly muttonchopped guys in this film i lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers i have a theory about the casting though all the bad guys were played by ugly actors and one ugly actress and all the good guysvictims were played by beautiful actors indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims the slaves were gorgeous as was the innocent priests daughter while the plantation owner his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes on purpose you make the call  i hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well if you just want to look at bare breasts there are plenty of them here and if you have a slavemaster fetish then youll love this film otherwise watch it once vomit shower and never speak of it to anyone,0
for a while it seemed like this show was on 247 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of continuation of this horrible show about the two most vapid and conceited people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish haggish airheads perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said  i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of faustian bargain in order to get their lizardly snouts on a television series may the fates protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls,0
i know a lot of people have said dont bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles that is a really lazy way to think of a movie if you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art this being a masterful piece of work if you want to watch this its not about the fighting really there are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part this is not the basic kungfu movie the story is really the central focus and not the fights and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching and is even better in the original language with subtitles,1
spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know its also the only one that focuses on the la punk explosion of the early eighties its all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on todays alternative rock music can not be overestimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences  the punks  all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music but the underground was rocking if you need a proof for that watch fears performance in decline unmatched great film how come this is not available on vid ld or dvd ps the followup decline pt ii is hilarious too,1
this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child it scared the living crap out of me so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through  nowadays the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies  i however still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness doug mcclure and peter cushing in the same movie great monsters made of polypropylene substitute scary stuff a rubber monster is when you think about it is even scarier than a real monster  the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is truly rousing stuff  theres also plenty of prehistoric tit on show too nice,1
i am definitely not a gamer but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are so a little reluctantly i decided to find out what the big deal was with fantasy stuff i saw dorkness rising and thought it was hilarious its slapstick but not disrespectful to those that enjoy role playing games also and most importantly people whove never gamed before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot the acting was great and the field shotsset were believable this makes me want to see other movies by this production company i cant wait to see what the future holds for this group three cheers  well done,1
i picked up a dvd at the 1 discount having no idea what its about but at that price i cant resist in brief i was positively surprised  so much that i did quite some research on the german dvd part 2 of a series of 3 episodes were recombined into two 85 minute parts and out of order here are my results based on wikipedias episode list  doomsday is in my boots  the voice final episode   war of the machines is hel  high water 1 2  pod listener  juggernaut down  well what can i say underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men i never watched charlies angels so much so i cant compare but the more i watched the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings instead the characters both m and f became more interesting i can imagine feminists have their fun with this too all in all maybe a guilty pleasure but a pleasure it was,1
i saw sea of dust as part of a nyc screening audience several years ago i enjoyed the film at that time so i was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since perhaps its my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the rhode island film festival im really not sure which version i prefer but i can honestly say that i found something to appreciate it both  let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie although its been promoted as a hammer films tribute people expecting a showdown between van helsing and dracula are going to be sorely disappointed theres some cleavage but no nudity a staple of the british production houses later movies and while sea of dust is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features hammer starlet ingrid pitt its not like any of the companys pictures in tone or execution this film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny i dont remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but thats not a bad thing especially the showdown in the black forest that plays like a three stooges short and some of ms pitts rantings are quite entertaining its like somebody wound her up and turned her loose  the uniqueness of this film doesnt lie with the borrowed details though its in the ideas as an occasional sci fi channel viewer ive regularly taken the network to task for its onenote variations on a theme cgi monster kills then gets destroyed sea of dust is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while  but dont get me wrong im not complaining if anything i applaud these guys for making such an enterprising lowbudget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts its not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are but for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket,1

this film is a summary of viscontis obssessions the decadence of nobility death aesthetic search homosexualityall mingled with melancholic mastery slowpaced just to make you abler to contemplate all its beauty which is in the music and the images as well as in the storythis is the type of film we are not allowed to enjoy anymore brave deeply personal and intelligent the genuine fruit of a genius like visconti,1
the problem with this and with all vietnam war films is that theyre all too biased antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of us soldiers were heroes while prowar films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie this film sucks its time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar nor liberal nor conservative but completely unbiased,0
one of the two best films of the year a well filmed well written well put together film with an outstanding cast lau ching wan and his friends dayo wong chi wa anthony wong chau sun francis ng chun yu jordan chan siu chun cheung man tat had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances theresa lee plays her comedic role well though much like a female version of michael wong her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes something i havent done since 1 the fan boys took over altasianmovies and 2 john woos hardboiled sure the ending was expected but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members highly enjoyable,1
silly and violent thriller that is a rip  off of deliverance but without any charm and intelligence the plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this,0

it is an interesting fact that metaphysics by platon and aristoteles formal logic and abstract ontology form about those sciences that most people are not interested in but then around one thousand years after aristoteles the computer began to usurp the human thinking and the humans who were refusing to reflect questions of being other than biological physical and chemical ones suddenly felt paralyzed because they could not cope with the consequences that this computers would bring over night rw fassbinders welt am draht together with tarkovskys solaris and godards alphaville is probably the first movie who took the philosophical questions of emerging computer science as a basis of a story to be told in a movie the confusing questions about identities and realities are cleverly built into different interwoven criminal stories which the audience really tries to follow because it is interested to solve the cases fassbinder was a master to sell highly abstracts contents to his public by embedding theoretical knowledge into practical appetizing forms the basis problem to understand is that an identity defines a reality but on the other side a reality also requires identity in order to be perceived the idea of a person with multiple identities is known to us solely from the standpoint of psychiatry however logically spoken the only reason why we have just one identity is the fact that our logic has only two values right and false now take a logic with just one more value ie with three then as you can easily see you have already three identities what happens now when let us say dr stiller gets killed then it is quite possible that only one of three identities is abolished and the other two remain and are able to rescue the individual from death another question is if a person with multiple identities actually feels these identities at once the idea however to display such sets of identities in a updown or downup way as shown in the scene with the elevator in the hotel is misleading since identities and hence realities are not structured in hierarchical but in a heterarchical way strictly speaking there is no artificial identity either since each identity is defined over two objects who share all of their features with one another therefore the idea of assuming that every individual has just one single identity is nothing but a consequence of ancient twovalued logic either a second identity would imply that a person at the same time exists and notexists but now look around and see that one and the same object which is by definition selfidentical is perceived by every subject in its own way if therefore every subject sees an object differently why should it no be possible for the single individual to open the borders of his twovalued individualitycorset with the effect that different persons can exchange their different individualities fassbinder would five years later pick up this topic in his masterpiece despair a trip into the light,1
this is my favourite kung fu movie it has a very authentic flavour seasoned by an eerie music score of tradition chinese instruments i think and some wonderfully overacted melodramatic moments contrasted by heavily affected comedy indeed while attempting to create their own western ie cowboy film genre the chinese concocted a whole new animal marked by kung fu fighting and its associated sound effects  the story of five fingers of death is simple a story of revenge for killing a loved one and the pursuit of the main character to master the ironfisttechnique that will enable him to wreak holy vengeance on his enemies there is even a love interest though the awkward polite kind found in most chinese films of the period the end result however is great and much more authentic than any bruce lee movie,1
first of all i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general its not that i dont like them just that i dont like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyedwerewolf of london 1935 stuart walker an american werewolf in london 1981 john landisand some that i have thought were okay but nothing specialthe wolf man 1941 george waggner the howling 1981 joe dante dog soldiers 2002 neil marshall are some examplesbut overall the werewolf subgenre is not my favorite but i had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so i thought id give it a watch and see how it was  spoilers follow  the mad monster is a werewolf tale but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist dr lorenzo cameron george zucco dr cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts specifically wolves but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community forced out of a prestigious position he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion where he lives with his daughter lenora the lovely anne nagel and his assistant petro glenn strange of limited mental abilities using his serum dr cameron transforms petro into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals eventually though the werewolf petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed  the movie also plays out somewhat as a murdercrime drama with lenoras journalist suitor johnny downs investigating the doctors strange behavior and the rash of murders the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it there are reminders of frankenstein 1931 james whale in the creation of a monster which runs amok and the creature killing an innocent child visions of dr jekyll and mr hyde 1931 rouben mamoulian or the 1941 victor fleming version and the wolf man 1941 george waggner also come to mind and that is one of the problems with this movie in my viewit comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films it doesnt add much to the genre  true there are some redeeming qualities george zuccos performance was convincing and the scene showing dr lorenzo talking to his visionshallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity there is some reasonable character build up at least in the case of his character but glenn stranges character is not at all convincing and seems to have this comedic qualitywhether intentional or not im not surethat just doesnt fit into the movie as a whole  i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of 410 but it was still a below average film perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930s and 1940s horror films but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not,0
this is a movie that deserves another lookif you havent seen it for a while or a first lookif you were too young when it came out 1983 based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actorsthe young able bodied ones being taken for military service it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his dresser so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth while tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theaterespecially shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity the backstage goingson make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers,1
this is the kind of film they used to make amusing heartwarming troubling authentic with convincing performances by people without nose jobs boob jobs eye jobs in other words real people shauna macdonald plays the female love interest and she is so real you want to give her a cuddle at the very least imagine that a real girl in a movie whatever next hollywood would hate her because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every false starlet in tinseltown this story has the same hilarious feel as sandy mackendricks classic whisky galore with the gnomic humour of remote scottish islanders puncturing the pretensions of intruders from outside and enjoying a wee dram from time to time the actual intervals between those times often being rather short director stephen whittaker displays a rare skill in pulling this off just right and it is shocking to discover that he died before his films release aged only 56 which was clearly a substantial loss to the screen ulrich thomsen does very well at playing a german rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to scarp in the isle of harris to build a small rocket to carry postal packets between the islands there he falls in love with the alluring macdonald lass and she reciprocates the affection some wonderfully colourful local characters decorate the tale and the film is pure delight there is of course the threat of imminent war with hitler and we learn that hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war which is a shocking statistic tragic love is never far from view but lips must remain sealed in a review as to what happens in the end this film is a magnificent example of just the kind of films which people in britain should be making but are they being properly released in a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality tv shows where repulsive nonentities have become the national heroes is there even a market anymore for a film like this after all there is no grunting sex there are no closeups of suppurating wounds or of anyones genitals there are no drugs taken there are no mindless celebrities prancing around wanting to be looked at and so one wonders whether there is anything to interest a public which has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their pointless existence anyone who is looking for an antidote to the vacuity of contemporary britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film,1
